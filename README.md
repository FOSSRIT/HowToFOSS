# How To FOSS

This book was compiled during an Independent Study course at [Rochester Institute
of Technology](http://www.rit.edu/), in conjunction with the [MAGIC Center](http://magic.rit.edu).
In it, you will find a collection of information that explain how to get started
in the free and open source community.

## Authors

[Daniel Jost](https://github.com/PxlBuzzard) and [Colden Cullen](https://github.com/ColdenCullen)
have worked together on nearly every project throughout their years at RIT.
After taking the Advanced FOSS course taught by [Remy DeCausemaker](https://github.com/decause),
they decided to obtain the [Free and Open Source Software & Free Culture](http://magic.rit.edu/foss/minor.html)
minor in their final semester, and they will be the first two students to
graduate with this qualification. This book fulfills a portion of the minor, and
will act as a curriculum for future FOSS classes.

[Daniel Jost](https://osrc.dfm.io/PxlBuzzard/) has always been interested in how
things work. Whether it was doing Public Relations for game mods like
[Conflict Earth 2142](http://www.moddb.com/mods/conflict-earth-2142),
[modifying the stylesheets](https://userstyles.org/users/14920) of various
websites, or majoring in Game Design & Development at RIT, Daniel lives with the
engineer's mantra to be curious. He has accepted a full-time position at
Microsoft where he will be working with web technology.

[Colden Cullen](https://osrc.dfm.io/ColdenCullen/) loves building stuff. He grew
up having built practically every Star Wars Lego set created. As soon as he
discovered code however, he was hooked. Now, he's relatively well known in the
[D language](http://dlang.org/) community, especially in the game development
circles, and is the Lead Engine Programmer on [Circular Studios](http://circularstudios.com/)'
[Dash Engine](https://github.com/Circular-Studios/Dash). Colden has accepted a
full-time position at Amazon where he will be working in the Video Games
division.
