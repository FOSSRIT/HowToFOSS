## Rationale
Wordpress is a gigantic thing. It powers (at least) 23% of the web.
(http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all) We wanted to
dive deeper into what the community looks like that generates such a massively
popular piece of software.

It was also one of the suggested ones, so that is also a reason.

Briefly describe and include a URL for each.

  - The Twitter handle mentioned above appears to be more or less a release log.

3. Does your subject organize or participate in any conferences? If so, list
them here, and provide links to any relevant sessions, keynotes, or content.
  - Wordcamp - first organized by Matt Mullenweg, but numerous spinoffs have
  been established. http://central.wordcamp.org/about/
  - There’s a conference aggregator named Lanyrd that has a Wordpress tag:
  http://lanyrd.com/topics/wordpress/

## Community Architecture
Your subject likely runs or contributes to one or more Open Source products or
projects. Choose one (or more) of these and answer the following questions:

If applicable, list and provide links to:

1. The project's IRC Channel
  - http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC

2. Source Code repository
  - https://core.svn.wordpress.org/trunk/
  - https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress

3. Mail list archive
  - http://codex.wordpress.org/Mailing_Lists

4. Documentation
  - http://codex.wordpress.org/

5. Other communication channels
  - They are currently evaluating Slack: https://make.wordpress.org/chat/

6. Project Website and/or Blog
  - https://wordpress.org/news/
  - https://wordpress.org/

7. Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.
  - Wordpress is a blogging platform and CMS. “...the mission of the WordPress
  open source project: to democratize publishing through Open Source, GPL
  software.” (http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Policies)

8. Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest
commit?
  - First commit: Tue Apr 1 06:17:43 2003 +0000
  - Latest commit: Probably in the last 24 hours.

9. Who approves patches? How many people?
  - It appears that the people who approve patches and those who have commit
  access are the same group.

10. Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted? How many total?
  - There are 42 people in the log of the SVN, so most likely a number smaller
  than 42 (assuming some people have since retired from contributing).

11. Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of
contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)
  - There is a list of “Developer Emeriti”, comprised of 10 people.
  (https://wordpress.org/about/)

12. Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent
Dictator for Life)
- Lead Developers: (https://wordpress.org/about/)
    - Helen Hou-Sandí
    - Dion Hulse
    - Mark Jaquith
    - Matt Mullenweg
    - Andrew Nacin
    - Andrew Ozz

13. Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the
proportion of each?
  - There are 4 people listed as “design”, so we will call them front end devs
  for our purposes. Discarding the non-differentiated “contributing developers”,
  that leaves a 4/6 split for frontend/backend.

14. What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen
during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?
  - A vast majority of Wordpress vulns are a result of third-party plugins, and
  as such, do not fall under the umbrella of the core project.
  - No major bugs / vulns in core Wordpress were highly publicized.

15. How is the project's participation trending and why?
  - The project’s number of contributors is difficult to gauge accurately -
  because of the architecture of the community, a large number of contributions
  via patches get “filtered” through a smaller number of people. As such, the
  number of contributors has remained roughly the same over time.
  (https://www.openhub.net/p/wordpress)

16. In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the
project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a
Velociraptor?) Why or why not?
  - Yes, because there are numerous people with access to the main repo.

17. In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active
20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?
  - Maybe not - the access to the main repo seems limited at best, and
  consequently the most active are the ones who have access.

18. Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place? (new
contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on
newbies, etc...)
  - There is a Contributor Handbook, but it’s in a very rough state:
  https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/

19. Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive? Does it
include code examples?
  - User documentation is at: http://codex.wordpress.org/
  - Code documentation is at: https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/
  - Both sets of documentation are extensive.

20. If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit
blockers, who would you contact, and how?
  - Asking in the Slack most likely, but it appears to be invite only / requires
  approval before accounts can be created.

21. Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making
structure/process of this group? Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled
by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of
individuals?
  - It’s a small group - one can only make changes with discrete patch files,
  not pull requests. Patches are submitted to the bug tracker
  (https://core.trac.wordpress.org/) and assessed / merged from there by core
  devs.

22. Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?
  - While the strict structure resulted in a very robust and very stable core
  product, it feels difficult to contribute. It also feels a little too reliant
  on a small group of people.

## Technology/Product (Section adapted from EFF Worksheet)
1. Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?
  - Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little founded Automattic Inc. to (initially) work
  on Wordpress.

2. What was the technology designed to do? How was it used?
  - "...the mission of the WordPress open source project: to democratize
  publishing through Open Source, GPL software."
  (http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Policies)
  - It is a browser based CMS / blogging platform.

3. Who would benefit from using this technology?
  - Anyone who wants to publish content, written or otherwise, easily online.

4. What kinds of companies or organizations (stakeholders) might have been
concerned about the development of this technology? Why?
  - Developers of other (commercial) blogging platforms, governments wishing to
  squelch dissent, and people who generally dislike blogs for whatever reason.

5. Did an aspect of copyright law play a role in controversies about the
technology? How?
  - A case of a fraudulent DMCA (fairly recent as well!):
