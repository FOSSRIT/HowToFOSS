Profile: Canonical / Ubuntu
===========================

### Authors
- Brian Escriche <Pharas/bke2759@rit.edu>
- Michael Tubinis <mtubinis/mst6119@rit.edu>

### Rationale

Pharas did not have a preference. I am starting my own linux project (a first) so I was looking at different distros. Ubuntu seemed to be the one I liked the most, so why not find more about it?

## Community Architecture

- [The project's IRC Channels](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ubuntu)
- [Source Code repository](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/)
- [Mail list archive](https://lists.ubuntu.com/)
- [Project Website](http://www.ubuntu.com/)

- Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.
	- Ubuntu comes from the African word Ubuntu meaning 'humanity to others'. Ubuntu was founded in 2004 as a free and easy to use Linux Desktop that was designed to be part social and part economic: free software, available to everybody on the same terms, and funded through a portfolio of services provided by Canonical. This from Wikipedia.  
- Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?
	- The project started before the initial release on 20 October 2004, The Warty Warthog Release. Ubuntu's latest release was on April 23, 2014, The Utopic Unicorn Release.
- Who approves patches? How many people?
	- [List](https://launchpad.net/~techboard/+members) - As far as we can tell, these seven. 
- Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted? How many total?
	- While the number is undoubtedly large, Ubuntu doesn’t have the information readily available to view. This is also tempered by which project you want to look at specifically
- Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)
  - It doesn’t look like the team has changed all that much, at least according to [this](https://launchpad.net/~techboard/+members)
- Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)
	- Mark Shuttleworth seems like as good a candidate as any. 
- Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?
  - While possible, it is doubtful that they are considering the amount of people using Ubuntu. It is more likely that there is more developing for the back-end though.
- What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?
	- There is very little forward facing information from Ubuntu, so it is hard to find anything concrete without delving into the mailing lists surrounding different project aspects.
- How is the project's participation trending and why?
  - Ubuntu is fairly popular, mostly because of how they do business and the thoroughness that they have with their product
- In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not? 
	- Yes, Ubuntu is backed by a huge, globe-spanning corporation and thousands, if not millions, of users.
- In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not? 
	- Yes, Ubuntu is backed by a huge, globe-spanning corporation and thousands, if not millions, of users.
- Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place? (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)
	- [link](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ContributeToUbuntu)  
- Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive? Does it include code examples?
	- There appears to be documentation for every project they have, with documentation even about adding to their documentation. There are code examples. 
- If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how? 
	- Depends entirely on which part you would be contributing to, as there are so many different IRCs, mailing lists, and wikis that are all organized by different people.
- Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group? Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?
	- It is entirely dependant on which project you are talking about, as the core Ubuntu project seems to be headed by the previously mentioned group of 7, but smaller divisions are present and dedicated to different aspects of the experience

## Technology/Product (Section adapted from EFF Worksheet)
- Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?
	- Landscape (Product). Landscape was created by Canonical. 
- What is the technology designed to do? How is it used?
	- Landscape is designed to assist in monitoring, managing, and updating an entire Ubuntu infrastructure from one single interface.
- Who would benefit from using this technology?
	- Server owners/administrators, IT managers, and similar people who are in charge of the infrastructure or a part of it would benefit from using this product.
- What kinds of companies or organizations (stakeholders) might have been concerned about the development of this technology? Why?
	- Since landscape is supposed to work mainly with Ubuntu, it would not be a direct conflict with other operating systems. Therefore only companies who are developing a similar kind of technology for Ubuntu, or developers of other distros that are in competition with Ubuntu would be concerned with the development of this technology from a business standpoint.
- Does/Did an aspect of copyright law play a role in controversies about the technology? How? There weren’t any issues that our team could find relating to copyright law.
  - Since the product is mostly limited as to what it can be used for, I don’t think it had any aspects of law or copyright law coming into question or being violated.
