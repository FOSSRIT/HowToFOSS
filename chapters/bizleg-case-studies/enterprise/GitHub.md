## Community Architecture

### Github and Government

- [Website](http://government.github.com)
- [Repository](http://github.com/github/government.github.com)
- The project is entirely documentation
- `Github and Government` is a website dedicated to sharing open government efforts that involve Github
- Started January 20, 2013, most recent commit March 5, 2015
- Two people ([benbalter][] and [jlord][]) accept all of the [pull requests][]
- [benbalter][] and [jlord][] seem to be the only two maintainers (BDFLs)
- The original developers have remained with the project the entire time.
- Development has been active throughout its lifetime
- The project would continue fine if one of the two main devs were eaten by a velociraptor
	- Not if the [top 20% of the contributors][contributors] were in a freak bus accident, though - that includes both BDFLs
- No onboarding, since most of it is adding information instead of code
- Ruled by a pair of individuals who try to make sure data is complete and accurate
- Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?
- This structure is well-suited for this project, but maybe not for a code-based project

## Technology/Product

Section adapted from [EFF Worksheet](http://www.teachingcopyright.org/handout/technology-history-worksheet)

### The Technology Behind GitHub

GitHub is powered completely by [Git][Git Wiki], a distributed source control system.

- Git was originally started by Linus Torvalds, creator of the Linux kernel.
- Git was initially started to track the Linux kernel and was then used by other projects.
- Lots of people interested in working on the same set of files or tracking changes in files could potentially use Git.

### GitHub Using Git

- Created to be a highly distributed SCM, GitHub based their entire product on using Git.
- GitHub now uses git as the tool it uses to track most of their repos and interface with GitHub.
- Contrary to popular belief, Git existed before GitHub. GitHub created a nice visual front end and a great central area for code repos.

### Copyright Law and Creation of Git

- The Linux kernel was originally tracked in BitKeeper, a properitary SCM.
- Devs of BitKeeper resciended license to use it and the kernel was left in the cold.
- Linus became fed up and created his own that would be FOSS so that incident could never happen again.

### Controversy over GitHub and Copyright

- GitHub is not open source, leading to an ironic situation that one of the most central sites for FOSS software isn’t FOSS itself.
- GitHub also has a default license that has been controversial over some of its terms.
