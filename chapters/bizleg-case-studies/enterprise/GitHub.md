## Community Architecture

### Github and Government

> The project's IRC Channel

N/A

> Source Code repository

[Repository](http://github.com/github/government.github.com)

> Mail list archive

N/A

> Documentation

The project is entirely documentation

> Other communication channels

N/A

> Project Website and/or Blog

[Website](http://government.github.com)

> Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.

`Github and Government` is a website dedicated to sharing open government efforts that involve Github

> Give a brief history of the project. When was the intial commit? The latest commit?

Started January 20, 2013
Most recent commit May 15, 2015 (As of May 17, 2015)

> Who approves patches? How many people?

Two people ([benbalter][] and [jlord][]) accept all of the [pull requests][]

> Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted? How many total?

[benbalter][] and [jlord][] seem to be the only two maintainers (BDFLs).

Numerous contributors adding individual stories.

> Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)

The original developers have remained with the project the entire time.

> Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)

Yes, [benbalter][] and [jlord][]

> Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?

The project is a website, so almost all work is frontend.

>  What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?

No real visible issues, the website is entirely documentation

> How is the project's participation trending and why?

Development has been active throughout its lifetime

> In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?

The project would continue fine if one of the two main devs were eaten by a velociraptor

> In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?

The [top 20% of the contributors][contributors] includes both BDFLs, so the project might not survive

> Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)

No onboarding, since most of it is adding information instead of code

> Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it include code examples?

Irrelevant, the project is essentially documentation itself.

> If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who
 would you contact, and how?

One of the BDFLs, in an issue on GitHub

> Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?

Ruled by a pair of individuals who try to make sure data is complete and accurate

> Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?

This structure is well-suited for this project, but maybe not for a code-based project

## Technology/Product

*Section adapted from [EFF Worksheet](http://www.teachingcopyright.org/handout/technology-history-worksheet)*

> Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?

GitHub is powered completely by [Git][Git Wiki], a distributed source control system.

- Git was originally started by Linus Torvalds, creator of the Linux kernel.
- Git was initially started to track the Linux kernel and was then used by other projects.

> What is the technology designed to do? How is it used?

- Created to be a highly distributed SCM, GitHub based their entire product on using Git.
- GitHub now uses git as the tool it uses to track most of their repos and interface with GitHub.
- Contrary to popular belief, Git existed before GitHub. GitHub created a nice visual front end and a great central area for code repos.

> Who would benefit from using this technology?

Lots of people interested in working on the same set of files or tracking changes in files could potentially use Git.

> What kinds of companies or organizations (stakeholders) might have been concerned about th
e development of this technology? Why?

Companies that market proprietary revision control systems would probably have been concerned about a free alternative that gained traction extremely quickly.

> Does/Did an aspect of copyright law play a role in controversies about the technology? How?

- The Linux kernel was originally tracked in BitKeeper, a properitary SCM.
- Devs of BitKeeper resciended license to use it and the kernel was left in the cold.
- Linus became fed up and created his own that would be FOSS so that incident could never happen again.
- GitHub is not open source, leading to an ironic situation that one of the most central sites for FOSS software isn’t FOSS itself.
- GitHub also has a default license that has been controversial over some of its terms.
