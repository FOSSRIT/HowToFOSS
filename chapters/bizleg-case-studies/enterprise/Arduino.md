> The project's IRC Channel

\#arduino on freenode

> Source Code repository

https://github.com/arduino/Arduino](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino)

> Mail list archive

> Other communication channels

Forums: [http://forum.arduino.cc/](http://forum.arduino.cc/)

> Project Website and/or Blog

[http://www.arduino.cc/](http://www.arduino.cc/)

> Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.

Arduino - Create an easy to use open hardware made for makers.

> Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?

- Initial commit: Thu Aug 25 21:06:28 2005 +0000
- Latest commit: Likely within 24 hours

> Who approves patches? How many people?

Many people approve patches on their github repo. At first glance it looks like there are 15 people who can merge.

> Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?

About 15 have commit access and there are currently over 400 pull requests.

> Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)

It seems many of the contributors only contribute for a short period of time. There are only a couple people who have continually contributed. [https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/graphs/contributors)

> Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)

No there have been many people with commit access access and many of the developers have contributed.

> Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?

N/A

> What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?

There is a dedicated bug tracking forum [here](http://forum.arduino.cc/?board=56.0).

> How is the project's participation trending and why?

It is increasing slowly. [https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/graphs/contributors)

> In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?

Yes, it would survive because there are others that are actively contributing to the project and know their way around the project.

> In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?

It would probably survive but would take a while to recover.

> Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)

- The IDE itself has significant documentation.
- If you’re looking to contribute to the project I can’t seem to find anything besides their [Contributor License Agreement](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ContributorLicenseAgreement)

> Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it include code examples?

Yes. It’s everywhere on their official site and even on the 3rd party sites explaining how to use arduinos.

> If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?

Probably the IRC channel. #arduino on freenode

> Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?

It seems like the project is ruled by a small group.

> Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?

The community structure seems stable, and are continually on top of pull requests and issues.


## Technology/Product

*Section adapted from [EFF Worksheet](http://www.teachingcopyright.org/handout/technology-history-worksheet)*

> Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?

Arduino

> What is the technology designed to do? How is it used?

Easy to use microcontrollers. Many Makers use the microcontrollers for various different projects.

> Who would benefit from using this technology?

Anyone trying to break in using hardware in a project.
