- Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.
	- The Software Freedom Conservancy is a non-profit organization whose purpose is to promote, improve, develop, and defend Free, Libre, and FLOSS projects.  They aim to provide a home and infrastructure for FLOSS projects and allow developers to focus more on developing. [1]
- Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?
	- Conservancy was established in 2006 and started coordinating with the BusyBox in 2007.  In 2015, Conservancy announced they were funding litigation by Christoph Hellwig against VMWare for copyright violation in an ESXi product.
- Who approves patches? How many people?
	- Conservancy is a legal team and supports FLOSS projects legally, but not in terms of patching.
- Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?
	- No one controls commit access - not applicable
- Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)
	- The current team of directors includes: Jeremy Allison, Peter T. Brown, Mark Galassi, Bradley M. Kuhn, Mike Linksvayer, Martin Michlmayr, Stormy Peters, and Karen Sandler.  The current list of project members of the Software Freedom Conservancy are: [1]
		- ArgoUML
		- Bongo
		- Boost
		- Buildbot
		- BusyBox
		- Darcs
		- Evergreen
		- Foresight Linux
		- Gevent
		- Git
		- GPL Compliance Project for Linux Developers
		- Inkscape
		- Kallithea
		- K-3D
		- Kohana
		- Libbraille
		- LuxRender
		- Mercurial
		- Metalink
		- OpenChange
		- OpenTripPlanner
		- phpMyAdmin
		- PyPy
		- SWIG
		- Samba
		- Selenium
		- Squeak
		- Sugar Labs
		- SurveyOS
		- Twisted

		- uClibc
- Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)
	- The president of the Conservancy is Bradley M. Kuhn, and the executive director is Karen Sandler. [1]
- Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?
	- N/A
- What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?
	- For major lawsuits see “Future and Law”
- How is the project's participation trending and why?
	- The Conservancy appears to be popular amongst larger FLOSS projects who need the legal side of Open Source dealt with.
- In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?
	- Seeing that there is a group of directors, the Conservancy would very likely pass the Raptor test.
- In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?
	- The Conservancy would take a big hit if they lost their directors due to a bus accident, but seeing as the backing members are mostly heavily invested large FLOSS projects, the members would probably see that the Conservancy was restored with new lawyers.
- Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)
	- Each application for a partner project are handled on a case by case basis. To become part of it you would have to reach out to them.
- Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it include code examples?
	- [See About -](https://sfconservancy.org/about/)
- If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?
	- [Email](info@sfconservancy.org)
- Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?
- Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?
	- The main decision makers are the board of directors. SFC can be considered as a lawyer group dedicated to helping open source projects.
	- Decisions ultimately are ruled by this small group, keeping the project owners stake in mind for the best interest of FOSS and the values it represents.
