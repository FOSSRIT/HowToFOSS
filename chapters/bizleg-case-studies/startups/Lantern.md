> Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.

Lantern is built by the Brave New Software Project, Inc, a registered 501c3 non-profit dedicated to using software to tackle tough global challenges. 
Brave New Software’s founder and Lantern lead developer, Adam Fisk, was formerly a lead developer of the peer-to-peer file sharing services LimeWire 
and LittleShoot. While working on these P2P architectures, Adam realized they could be useful in providing unfiltered internet access.

> Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?

The Initial Commit for the project is on July 7th, 2010. The latest commit was on May 18th, 2015.

> Who approves patches? How many people?

There are 6 people who can approve of patches, though two seem to be the most active.

> Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?

Other than the 6 who can approve patches, there are only 11 other people with a history of commits to the project all together, and between them there is only around 100 commits.

> Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)

According to the github repo graphs, myleshorton has been the leader since the project started. From october 2013 on, oxtoacart has joined and contributed alot of code development.
These two have since then stayed and contributed steadily as the core team members.

> Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)

Adam Fisk

> Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?

According to the commit history, it seems like the answer is yes, as there are so few commits outside of the top two contributors

> What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?

[Issue Tracker](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/issues). Of note is an issue with Reset not working properly and messsing with people’s ability to
work the software: [Issue 1841](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/issues/1841).

> How is the project's participation trending and why?

[Github contributor graph] (https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/graphs/contributors). It seems to have gone down as time has went on,
though that has probably more to do with having less and less project critical work to do. That said, there are still several open issues and
development has seemed to recently picked up again after a long hault.

> In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?

No, from what we can tell, only 2 people have really contributed to the repo code wise, and even then the BDFL has had a lot more commits and has worked on the project way longer than the second leading contributor.

> In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?

Probably not. If the two main contributors were removed then the project would fall, due to most of the development knowledge being lost. Also, the project is fairly new, has not left beta stage yet, and has weak documentation. These factors will only hinder the project if it tries to revive itself.

> Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)

The [wiki](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/wiki) has links to a [Get Involved page](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/wiki/Get-Involved) and other various links that will help people start contributing towards the project.

> Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it include code examples?

The project does have documentation but it is weak, and no code samples are present other than some basic terminal / command line code to set up the project on various platforms.

> If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?

I would head to the forums first as that seems to be the most active communication area.

> Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?

The entire project is run by the BDFL Adam Fisk.

> Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?

Hard to say, as it really doesn’t have a formal structure outside of “There is this thing to work on, someone should work on it”.


## Technology/Product

*Section adapted from [EFF Worksheet](http://www.teachingcopyright.org/handout/technology-history-worksheet)*

> Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?

The project was started by Adam Fisk.

> What is the technology designed to do? How is it used?

It was designed with the intention of spreading internet to those who would normally not be able to receive it.

> Who would benefit from using this technology?

People in countries with heavily censored Internet (i.e. China, Iran).

> What kinds of companies or organizations (stakeholders) might have been concerned about the development of this technology? Why?

Interestingly enough, Google has stepped forward with something similar in uProxy. This was worked on collaboratively with Adam Fisk in some regard, so not quite the same thing though.

> Does/Did an aspect of copyright law play a role in controversies about the technology? How?

Has been strongly opposed by China, but otherwise, mostly silent. There has been some concern over the funding coming from the State department however.

## Business and Revenue Model

> How was this organization funded originally?

There is no information as to how the project was originally funded.
