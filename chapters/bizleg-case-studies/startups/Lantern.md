> Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.

From their FAQ: Lantern is built by the Brave New Software Project, Inc, a registered 501c3 non-profit dedicated to using software to tackle tough global challenges. Brave New Software’s founder and Lantern lead developer, Adam Fisk, was formerly a lead developer of the peer-to-peer file sharing services LimeWire and LittleShoot. While working on these P2P architectures, Adam realized they could be useful in providing unfiltered internet access.

According to the github repo graphs, myleshorton has been the leader since the project started. From october 2013 on, oxtoacart has joined and contributed alot of code development.

[Adam Fisk (myleshorton)]

Of note is an issue with Reset not working properly and messsing with people’s ability to work the software

> How is the project's participation trending and why?

It seems to have gone down as time has went on, though that has probably more to do with having less and less project critical work to do. That said, there has been nothing for the last few months and still several open issues

> In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?

No, there is too large a difference between what the BDFL has put in compared to everyone else

> In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?

No, as the top twenty percent would in fact take out almost one hundred percent of the people that have done anything with the project

> Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)

[The wiki](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/wiki) has links to a [Get Involved](https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/wiki/Get-Involved) and other various links that will help people start contributing towards the project.

> Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it include code examples?

The project does have documentation but it is weak, and no code samples are present.

> If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?

I would head to the forums first as that seems to be the most active communication area.

> Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?

Adam Fisk runs pretty much everything

> Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?

There is no formal structure, so it is hard to say it would be anything to enjoy being a part of


## Technology/Product

*Section adapted from [EFF Worksheet](http://www.teachingcopyright.org/handout/technology-history-worksheet)*

> Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?

Adam Fisk

> What is the technology designed to do? How is it used?

It was designed with the intention of spreading internet to those who would normally not be able to receive it.

> Who would benefit from using this technology?

People in countries with heavily censored Internet (i.e. China, Iran)

> What kinds of companies or organizations (stakeholders) might have been concerned about the development of this technology? Why?

Interestingly enough, Google has stepped forward with something similar in uProxy. This was worked on collaboratively with Adam Fisk in some regard, so not quite the same thing though.

> Does/Did an aspect of copyright law play a role in controversies about the technology? How?

Has been strongly opposed by China, but otherwise, mostly silent. There has been some concern over the funding coming from the State department however.
