## Technology / Product

- IndieGoGo was started in 2007 under the name Project Keiyaku by Danae Ringelmann, Eric Schell, and Slava Rubin. It officially launched in January 2008 at Sundance.
- IndieGoGo is meant to allow people to start up any idea they want and crowdsource the funds from other people. Generally speaking, IndieGoGo is used to give ideas that normally wouldn’t get anywhere a chance in the light.
- Anybody can start a campaign. More directly, people who need just a little more funding before they can launch their project.
- IndieGoGo charges 9% on the funds you raise. If you meet your goal, you get 5% of them back. More information can be found at their [Fees & Pricing] (https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/204456408-Fees-Pricing) page.
- The biggest concern about crowdsourcing in general is that legitimate startups circumvent the need for Venture-capital. This is merely postponing it, as the startups hit the point at which they need to expand. 
- There has been some controversy surrounding IndieGoGo, but little to none of it has to do with copyright law. Namely IndieGoGo now no longer has the same fraud guarantees.
