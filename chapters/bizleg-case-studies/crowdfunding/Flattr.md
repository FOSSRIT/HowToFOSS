16. In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the
project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a
Velociraptor?) Why or why not?
  - Yeah I believe the project would continue. The project is a company so when
  people are lost most times, people would hire others to take their place.

17. In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active
20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?
  - People depend on Flattr to employ them and with this I think the project
  would continue.

contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on
newbies, etc...)

  [here](http://developers.flattr.net/). There are also a few plugins on their
  github account that you could use as examples.

20. If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit
blockers, who would you contact, and how?
  - Stackoverflow with the [flattr](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/flattr)
  tag or the Website [contact form](https://flattr.com/contact)

21. Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making
structure/process of this group? Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled
by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of
individuals?
  - Assuming Hierarchical as it is a business.

22. Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?
  - It’s a normal work place I’m assuming. As far as plugin development with
  flattr you’re pretty much on your own and you should have all the resources
  you would need.
