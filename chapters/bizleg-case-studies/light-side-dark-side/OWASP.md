## Community Architecture

*Your subject likely runs or contributes to one or more Open Source products or projects. Choose one (or more) of these and answer the following questions (provide links is applicable).*

OWASP does not have a source code repository itself as it is a coalition of projects. For this section we decided to write about one of their flagship projects in review called "[Dependency Check](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Dependency_Check)"

> The project's IRC Channel

The project does not have an IRC channel.

> Source Code repository

[Source Code repository](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck)

> Mail list archive

[Mailing list](http://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/mail-lists.html)

> Documentation

> Other communication channels

[Issue Tracker](http://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/issue-tracking.html)

> Project Website and/or Blog

[Website](http://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/)

> Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.

Dependency-check is an open source solution the OWASP Top 10 2013 entry: A9 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities. Dependency-check can currently be used to scan Java applications (and their dependent libraries) to identify known vulnerable components.

> Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?

Initial commit was on September 6th, 2012. Latest commit was on May 6th, 2015.

> Who approves patches? How many people?

Jeremy Long is the only one who can approve patches.

> Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?

There have been 12 contributors to the project overall. Anyone seems to be able to submit pull requests, but only Jeremy Long can approve them.

> Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)

There has been no change in the core team since there really is no core team, just the BDFL, who has stayed active for the entire duration of the project's history.

> Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)

Jeremy Long is the BDFL.

> Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?

Since Jeremy Long is the main developer by an overwhelming majority, the front and back end developers are the same people (or rather the same person, the BDFL).

> What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?

There have been no major bugs or problems within the project code wise, and there is no clear indication as to who is in charge of problems. We assume it is the BDFL.

> How is the project's participation trending and why?

The project's participation trending is fairly consistent with Jeremy Long committing most of the code.

> In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?

The project would not survive the Raptor test since only one person has really contributed to the project.

> In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?

The project would not survive the Git by a bus test since only one person has really contributed to the project.

> Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)

There is no clear indication of an on-boarding process.

> Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it include code examples?

For documentation, [http://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/](http://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/) has a large amount of information about the project, but nothing as far as code.

> If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?

Contributing to the project will most likely need to be started by contacting the BDFL Jeremy Long on the mailing list via [Subscribe](dependency-check+subscribe@googlegroups.com) or [Post](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/wiki/dependency-check@googlegroups.com)

> Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?

It is no doubt ruled by a single individual, the BDFL Jeremy Long

> Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?

Since there is no real structure to the project's community, I would personally not enjoy working on this project.
