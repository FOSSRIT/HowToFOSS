- Sugar is the core component of a worldwide effort to provide every child with equal opportunity for a quality education.
- The first commit was Apr 16, 2006. The latest commit was Apr 28, 2015.
- Each core module and activity has it's own project lead and co-maintainers.
- There are 62 people who have had commits accepted into the main project.
- The core commiters have changed over time. At the beggining there were 3 major commiters who haven't added anything in awhile.
- Daniel Varvaez is the Lead maintainer for the core sugar project.
- There are different people working on the frontend and the backend.
- Participation seems to be trending down recently but there was a big push between October 2014 and January 2015.
- The project would pass the raptor test as there are multiple people running each team.
- I don't think this project would pass the bus test. The documentations isn't as detailed as it could be.
- Contributing to both the main process and adding new activities has a well documented getting started guide.
- The documentation is well broken up so you only need to look at the things for the particular thing you're doing, such as the main project or an activiy.
- I would contact the maintainers for whichever porition of the project I was working on, either by email or hopping into IRC.
- Each individual portion of Sugar has it's own ruling group.

## Technology/Product
- Sugar Labs helped produce the operating system and environment that runs on the One Laptop Per Child laptops.
- Sugar OS is based off of Fedora and includes the “Sugar software.”
- Sugar software is typically written in Python which is then turned into a Sugar activity that can be installed on OLPC laptops.
- Also provide “Sugar-on-a-stick” which is a live USB based off Fedora that can be booted on any computer to use the Sugar environment.
