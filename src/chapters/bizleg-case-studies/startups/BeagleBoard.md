### Rationale

There are **so** many subjects you could choose to profile, so why did you choose this one?
What drew you into wanting to know more about the organization?
How did you/your group decide on and agree?

We chose the Beaglebone organization as lots of us have used either one of their products or a similar product like the Raspberry Pi.
It's a really cool company that has lots of potential for helping people get really cool embedded projects off the ground.

## Community Architecture

- [IRC](irc://irc.freenode.net/#beagle)
- [Source Code](https://github.com/beagleboard/linux)
- [Forums](http://beagleboard.org/Community/Forums/)
- [Documentation](http://beagleboard.org/getting-started)
- [Project Website](http://beagleboard.org/)
- Provides a kernel for BeagleBoard and BeagleBone devices
- Repository is large enough that it defies analysis
- Encorporates the Linux kernel
- Large number of contributors as a result, but few pull requests for the repository itself
- This repository's main differences are the BeagleBone specific drivers, etc
- Documentation for submitting patches is from the original Linux kernel
	- Uses upstream changes, but non-upstream contributions must be BeagleBone-specific
- Hierarchical, one component of mainline Linux development

### Callaway Coefficient of Fail

- Hard to apply to open hardware projects as much of the code written specifically for the project are spread throughout forks of other projects.
- Source Control
	- Public (Github +0)
	- Webviewer (Github +0)
	- Source control tool (Git +0)
- Communication
	- Announce releases (Newsletter, Github +0)
	- Bug tracker (Github +0)
	- Website (beaglebone.org +0)

### Bus Test

- The GitHub organization only has 4 people on it. Fail.

## Technology/Product

### Beaglebone Boards

- Beagleboardorg has created several "boards" that are typically used in embedded Linux applications.
- Their current most popular board is the BeagleBone Black which is based off of an ARM chipset and runs Linux.
- The BeagleBone Black can be expanded by things called "Capes" which are attachments that can provide various additional functionality.
- Their older boards are the BeagleBoard, Beagleboard XM, and the BeagleBone.
- Over the years due to embedded technology getting better, their products have gotten cheaper and more powerful.
