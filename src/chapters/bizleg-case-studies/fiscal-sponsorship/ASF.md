> Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.

“The Apache Software Foundation provides support for the Apache community of open-source software projects, which provide software products for the public good.” ([https://www.apache.org/](https://www.apache.org/))

> Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?

N/A, as the ASF is an oversight body covering a vast number of projects, each with unique commit logs.

> Who approves patches? How many people?

There is a [fantastically large list](https://people.apache.org/committers-by-project) of commiters organized by project.

> Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?

There are 4,253 people listed on the [commiters page](https://people.apache.org/committer-index.html). 

> Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)

N/A. The Apache Software Foundation has an elected board of directors.

> Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)

No.

> Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?

N/A, as the organization doesn't really have a front end or back end.

> What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?

N/A, the overseeing body doesn't really have bugs, since they don't really write code. 

> How is the project's participation trending and why?

Up, the number of current members is quite large. It may be that they don’t demote users for inactivity, so it is a false sense of growth.

> In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?

Yes, the foundation is mainly run by the community so many people would be able step and take over the role.

> In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?

Yes. The Apache Software Foundation board of directors is elected.

> Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)

There is a “Get Involved” landing page that directs users to further information: [https://www.apache.org/foundation/getinvolved.html](https://www.apache.org/foundation/getinvolved.html)

> Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it include code examples?

The ASF has a “top-level” wiki. “This General Wiki is a top-level overview of other wikis at the Apache Software Foundation, as well as overall Foundation-level information, at the bottom of this page.” ([https://wiki.apache.org/general/](https://wiki.apache.org/general/))

> If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?

IRC would likely be the first place to go.

> Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?

Consensus building.

> Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?

The ASF has extensive documentation and guides to getting started on any of the numerous projects it oversees - it seems inviting and friendly.

## Technology/Product

*Section adapted from [EFF Worksheet](http://www.teachingcopyright.org/handout/technology-history-worksheet)*

> Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?

The Apache Foundation is funding many different projects from donations.

> What is the technology designed to do? How is it used?

-  provide a foundation for open, collaborative software development projects by supplying hardware, communication, and business infrastructure;
- create an independent legal entity to which companies and individuals can donate resources and be assured that those resources will be used for the public benefit;
- provide a means for individual volunteers to be sheltered from legal suits directed at the Foundation's projects; and,
- protect the 'Apache' brand, as applied to its software products, from being abused by other organizations.
([source](http://www.apache.org/foundation/faq.html#why))

> Who would benefit from using this technology?

Open Source Projects

> What kinds of companies or organizations (stakeholders) might have been concerned about the development of this technology? Why?
