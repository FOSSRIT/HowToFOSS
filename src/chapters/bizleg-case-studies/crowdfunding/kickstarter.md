## Community Architecture

Because of the nature of crowdsourcing platforms, we chose to study one of the
projects that came about thanks to Kickstarter.  Here, we will cover Pebble
Smartwatch.

> The project's IRC Channel

 #pebble on Freenode

> Source Code repository

[Github](https://github.com/pebble)

> Mail list archive

None.

> Documentation

http://developer.getpebble.com

> Other communication channels

http://developer.getpebble.com/community/

> Project Website and/or Blog

https://developer.getpebble.com/blog

> Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.

The Pebble Smartwatch was created to redefine the idea of a smartwatch. It was
one of the first smartwatches to sync with a smartphone, and ended up being
arguably the catalyst for interest in the smartwatch space.

> Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?

The first Kickstarter campaign was launched on April 11, 2012, and the watch
was first shipped to backers in January, 2013. The latest version, Pebble Time,
began its Kickstarter campaign on February 24, 2015 (the watch has not shipped
yet, as of May 17, 2015).

> Who approves patches? How many people?

Eric Migicovsky, Founder and CEO of Pebble and inventor of the watch, has a
large say, as well as the Head of Product, Itai Vonshak, and the Head of
Industrial Design, Mork Solomon.

> Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?

Not applicable -- the watch is closed source.

> Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of
> contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)

The original people are still at the helm.

> Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator
> for Life)

No, but it is unlikely that Migicovsky will step down anytime soon.

> Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion
> of each?

Not applicable -- the watch is closed source.

> What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during
> development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?

Not applicable -- the watch is closed source.

> How is the project's participation trending and why?

Interest seems to only be increasing.  The first Kickstarter pulled in $10.2M,
while the second recieved $20.3M.

> In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the
> project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a
> Velociraptor?) Why or why not?

Considering the overwhelming success of the platform, and the interest in
smartwatches overall, it is unlikely that any sort of disaster would leave
the company unable to pick up the (time)pieces.

> In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active
> 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?

See above.

> Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new
> contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically
> on newbies, etc...)

See the links to the developer resources above.

> Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it
> include code examples?

See the links to the developer resources above.

> If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit
> blockers, who would you contact, and how?

Not applicable -- the only way to help would be to contribute to their next
Kickstarter campaign.

> Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making
> structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building,
> ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair
> of individuals?

Ruled by a small group.

> Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?

Yes, the innovative mindsets of the Pebble team have given us a cool product
which has inspired competition from very large names.


## Technology/Product

*Section adapted from
[EFF Worksheet](http://www.teachingcopyright.org/handout/technology-history-worksheet)*

> Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?

Eric Migicovsky was the original creator of the Pebble watch.

> What is the technology designed to do? How is it used?

It's designed to allow users to keep in touch with their online lives without
taking out a device.

> Who would benefit from using this technology?

This technology would benefit both people who want to be less connected to
their phones (because they can stay connected without using their phone) as
well as people who want to stay hyperconnected (because they can stay connected
without using their phone).

> What kinds of companies or organizations (stakeholders) might have been
> concerned about the development of this technology? Why?

I think only competing smartwatch producers would be concerned about the
development of the Pebble, and being that it wasn't a huge space when the
Pebble was first put on Kickstarter, I don't think any stakeholders would be
particularly concerned.

> Does/Did an aspect of copyright law play a role in controversies about the
> technology? How?

No.


## Business and Revenue Model

> How was this organization funded originally?

Venture firms and angel investors.

> How does this organization make revenue?

Fees off of successful campaigns.

> Which specific Open Source Revenue Models are utilized?

Not applicable -- Kickstarter is not open source.

> What investments/acquisitions has the organization made?

None.
