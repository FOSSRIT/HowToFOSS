> Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.

Gratipay is all about open. The company itself is one of the first ones to become an ‘open company’. Everything is open from financials to the source code, which is pretty cool. They have very simple goals in mind and they understand they need rules, so they have those as well.

It is just a simple service to help open people support open and free software by their mean. The payment itself is open by nature and so there is no scamming involved. Just people helping people and using technology to help out. 

They have some revenue on a ‘pay what you want’ basis when a user executes a payment to another user.

To preserve the simpleness of the company I will leave the overview simple.

> Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?

JAN 2012 was the initial commit up to 04/15 being the latest. Its pretty active and this all started from Chad Whittacre

> Who approves patches? How many people?

Everyone who has repo owner status are shown [here](https://github.com/orgs/gratipay/people). There are about 12 of them 


> Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?

Everyone who has repo owner status and are shown [here](https://github.com/orgs/gratipay/people). There are about 12 of them

> Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)

No, Chad is and keeps being at the center of the operation. 

> Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)

Yes, Chad Whitacre is at the core of the operation. 

> Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?

Everyone who has repo owner status and are shown [here](https://github.com/orgs/gratipay/people). There are about 12 of them

> What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?

Chad is usually the go-to for fixing major bugs and issues.

> How is the project's participation trending and why?

Its in ever-increasing trend. Because the vision is very clean. Help little by little. Not billions, not nothing. Just give out of the heart.

> In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?

No, Chad Whitacre is at the core of the team. Most accounts and formal legal monetary holdings are only owned by him.

> In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?

No. Chad Whitacre is at the core of the team. Most accounts and formal legal monetary holdings are only owned by him.

> Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)

The on-boarding is simply as easy as following their [guide](http://inside.gratipay.com/big-picture/welcome).

> Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it include code examples?

It has pretty solid 'wiki' that you can see [here](http://inside.gratipay.com/big-picture/welcome).

> If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?

You would go to the IRC channel or even shoot Chad an email. They would be the ones to help. The codebase isn't to big where it's too much of an issue.

> Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?

So mostly its reigned by a small group which is lead by Chad. However the consensus is built as a small community that gratipay has built.

> Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?

It would be beneficial but not the best. Sometimes being too open is more of a hassle then it is productive.
