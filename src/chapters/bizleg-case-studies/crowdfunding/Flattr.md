  - leihog - Leif Högberg

> Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent
Dictator for Life)
  
The founders? - Peter Sunde and Linus Olsson. This is unknown because
it is a private company.

Unknown. This is a private company.

Unknown

> In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the
project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a
Velociraptor?) Why or why not?

Yeah I believe the project would continue. The project is a company so when
people are lost most times, people would hire others to take their place.

> In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active
20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?

People depend on Flattr to employ them and with this I think the project
would continue.

> Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place? (new
contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on
newbies, etc...)

No onboarding process exists except for the documentation.

> Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive? Does it
include code examples?

The service has API documentation located
[here](http://developers.flattr.net/). There are also a few plugins on their
github account that you could use as examples.

> If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit
blockers, who would you contact, and how?

Stackoverflow with the [flattr](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/flattr)
tag or the Website [contact form](https://flattr.com/contact)

> Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making
structure/process of this group? Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled
by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of
individuals?

Assuming Hierarchical as it is a business.

> Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?

It’s a normal work place I’m assuming. As far as plugin development with
flattr you’re pretty much on your own and you should have all the resources
you would need.

### Technology/Product (Section adapted from EFF Worksheet)
> Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?

Many different companies influenced this model including Kickstarter,
HumbleBundle, and Gratipay

> What was the technology designed to do? How was it used?

It was designed to allow people to give back to content creators

Content Creators

concerned about the development of this technology? Why?

Any kind of content creator, including photographers, writers, coders, and
many others even musicians.

technology? How?

It allows people to release their content without having to worry about how
they can profit from their copyright, which prospers the open source
environment around the projects.
