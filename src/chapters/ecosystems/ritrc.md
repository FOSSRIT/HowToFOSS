# RIT Research Computing

#### [Homepage](http://rc.rit.edu)

> Our mission is to foster research at RIT by partnering with researchers to
support advanced research technology resources in computation, collaboration,
and community building among RIT research faculty, staff and students.

> Our guiding principles are communication, collaboration, and service. We aim
to know the researchers, their research, and their needs. We want to involve
researchers in our planning process and communicate our capabilities and vision
to researchers.

> Our goals are to help researchers help themselves, collaborate on research
projects, develop innovative technologies, provide core resources, and build a
research user community.
