> codeRIT represents a coalition of RIT students with a mission to represent the
RIT hackathon community on a national level. It focuses its attention towards
increasing its relationship with other collegiate technical communities,
teaching software development and entrepreneurial skills to its members, and
uniting a fragmented collection of groups amongst GCCIS as one RIT group.
