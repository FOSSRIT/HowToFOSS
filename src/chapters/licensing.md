# Licensing Overview and Resources

First, the standard disclaimer: **This book is not a lawyer, and this does not
constitute legal or financial advice.**

Licenses are a critical component of any open source project. The license
dictates how the project can be used and contributed to by others, and
neglecting to include a license does not mean you are putting your code in the
public domain. [Paul Rubens](//www.cio.com/article/2382115/open-source-tools/how-to-choose-the-best-license-for-your-open-source-software-project.html)
explains,

> As an independent developer you are under no obligation to use any license at
all, but that may have unintended consequences. That's because many people
believe that by providing no licensing terms they are releasing it into the
public domain. In fact, the reverse turns out to be the case: If you release
your code without any license then it is automatically copyrighted. That means
that no-one can reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from it.

## Common FOSS Licenses

[ChooseALicense.com](//choosealicense.com) and the
[Open Source Initiative](//opensource.org/licenses) are good places to help you
choose what license works best for your project.

[MIT](//opensource.org/licenses/MIT) - "I want it simple and permissive."

> The MIT License is a permissive license that is short and to the point. It
lets people do anything they want with your code as long as they provide
attribution back to you and don't hold you liable.

jQuery and Rails use the MIT License.

[Apache](//opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) - "I'm concerned about patents."

> The Apache License is a permissive license similar to the MIT License, but
also provides an express grant of patent rights from contributors to users.

Apache, SVN, and NuGet use the Apache License. - "I care about sharing
improvements."

[GPL](//opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license)

> The GPL ([V2](http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0) or
[V3](http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0)) is a copyleft license that
requires anyone who distributes your code or a derivative work to make the
source available under the same terms. V3 is similar to V2, but further
restricts use in hardware that forbids software alterations.

Linux, Git, and WordPress use the GPL.

[Creative Commons](//creativecommons.org/choose/?lang=en) - "I have some
creative work that isn't code."

> Every license helps creators — we call them licensors if they use our tools —
retain copyright while allowing others to copy, distribute, and make some uses
of their work — at least non-commercially. Every Creative Commons license also
ensures licensors get the credit for their work they deserve.

This book and Wikipedia use Creative Commons.

If you have any questions about which license to pick, there are some mailing
lists that may help you with your specific situation:
