<p>This book was compiled during an Independent Study course at <a href="http://www.rit.edu/">Rochester Institute of Technology</a>, in conjunction with the <a href="http://magic.rit.edu">MAGIC Center</a>. In it, you will find a collection of information that explain how to get started in the free and open source community.</p>
<h2 id="authors"><a class="header" href="#authors">Authors</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/PxlBuzzard">Daniel Jost</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ColdenCullen">Colden Cullen</a> have worked together on nearly every project throughout their years at RIT. After taking the Advanced FOSS course taught by <a href="https://github.com/decause">Remy DeCausemaker</a>, they decided to obtain the <a href="http://magic.rit.edu/foss/minor.html">Free and Open Source Software &amp; Free Culture</a> minor in their final semester, and they will be the first two students to graduate with this qualification. This book fulfills a portion of the minor, and will act as a curriculum for future FOSS classes.</p>
<p><a href="https://osrc.dfm.io/PxlBuzzard/">Daniel Jost</a> has always been interested in how things work. Whether it was doing Public Relations for game mods like <a href="http://www.moddb.com/mods/conflict-earth-2142">Conflict Earth 2142</a>, <a href="https://userstyles.org/users/14920">modifying the stylesheets</a> of various websites, or majoring in Game Design &amp; Development at RIT, Daniel lives with the engineer's mantra to be curious. He has accepted a full-time position at Microsoft where he will be working with web technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://osrc.dfm.io/ColdenCullen/">Colden Cullen</a> loves building stuff. He grew up having built practically every Star Wars Lego set created. As soon as he discovered code however, he was hooked. Now, he's relatively well known in the <a href="http://dlang.org/">D language</a> community, especially in the game development circles, and is the Lead Engine Programmer on <a href="http://circularstudios.com/">Circular Studios</a>' <a href="https://github.com/Circular-Studios/Dash">Dash Engine</a>. Colden has accepted a full-time position at Amazon where he will be working in the Video Games division.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-open-source-mean"><a class="header" href="#what-does-open-source-mean">What does open source mean?</a></h3>
<p>An open source project is a project where a few conditions are met:</p>
<ol>
<li>The code is available to download, for free</li>
<li>The code is <em>legally</em> usable by others (see chapter 2)</li>
<li>Contributions from external programmers are accepted (and encouraged)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="why-should-i-open-source-my-project"><a class="header" href="#why-should-i-open-source-my-project">Why should I open source my project?</a></h3>
<p>The idea behind open sourcing a project is that by allowing the public to view
and use your code, you gain a few things. In their article title
<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/12/27/open-sourcing-projects-guide-getting-started/">So You’ve Decided To Open-Source A Project At Work. What Now?</a>,
<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a> lists the following
advantages:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Technical brand:
Companies want to be known as a place where smart people work. One excellent way
to show this is by releasing code that has been written at the company. Doing so
creates mindshare in the community, familiarity with the company and its
contributions, and fodder for future technical brand initiatives (such as giving
talks at meetups and conferences).</li>
<li>Recruiting:
Time and again, you’ll see contributors joining companies that sponsor
open-source projects. I saw this happen frequently while at Yahoo, where
<a href="http://yuilibrary.com/">YUI</a> contributors would sometimes end up as Yahoo
employees after having contributed to the project on an ongoing basis. Similar
hires have occurred in the Node.js community. The reason is pretty clear: If you
work on an open-source project in your spare time, imagine how great it would be
to turn that hobby into a job. Additionally, allowing job candidates to see some
of the company’s code gives some good insight into what working at the company
would be like.</li>
<li>Giving back:
A lot of companies benefit from open-source software, and contributing
open-source software back into the world is a way of giving back. These days,
it’s part of what it means to be involved in the technical community. When you
receive, find a way to give back. A lot of companies are embracing this
philosophy.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Visibility:
If you're looking for a job, companies look to see what you're capable of.
A great way to see what you're capable of is to see what you've done. Having
code in a well known open source project is a great way to show that you know
how to write good code, and a great way to get your name out there.</li>
<li>You'll learn a ton:
Chances are, you don't know everything. Chances are, if you contribute to a
project like Node.js, there will be other people contributing, many of whom will
be smarter than you are. Being able to see and work with code written by more
experienced engineers is a great way to learn a ton, and to get much better at
what you do.</li>
<li>Bragging Rights:
How many people can say that they have written code in Node.js? Not many (552 at
the time of writing). Being able to say that you're one of the proud few to
be a contributor to a project that people have heard of is a pretty cool
thing.</li>

<p>First, the standard disclaimer: <strong>This book is not a lawyer, and this does not

<p>Licenses are a critical component of any open source project. The license
dictates how the project can be used and contributed to by others, and
neglecting to include a license does not mean you are putting your code in the

explains,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an independent developer you are under no obligation to use any license at
all, but that may have unintended consequences. That's because many people
believe that by providing no licensing terms they are releasing it into the
public domain. In fact, the reverse turns out to be the case: If you release
your code without any license then it is automatically copyrighted. That means
that no-one can reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from it.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-dash"><a class="header" href="#what-is-dash">What Is Dash?</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Circular-Studios/Dash">Dash</a> is a free and open source 3D
game engine. The following is a summation of the <a href="https://github.com/Circular-Studios/Dash/wiki/Engine-History">full
history</a> of Dash.</p>
<p>What started as an engine that Colden made for a class became Dash over a year
and a half of taking on more developers and iterating on the components.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the team approached the end of the Fall 2013 semester there were mixed
feelings about the engine. On the one hand we were happy with our
accomplishments, but there were serious concerns around maintainability and
scalability.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Colden and Eric drew the D language out of a hat for a CS course during the
fall. They quickly fell in love with the language, and were excited to sell
the team on using it to do a full rewrite using D. A rewrite would also rid
the engine of the bloat that had been building up over the last year and give
a renewed focus on what the engine could be.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But what should Dash be? At first we thought it should be a résumé piece, but
that seemed too short-sighted. Some sort of undergraduate capstone project to
show the school administration they should provide a more legitimate offering
for large projects? Yes, but that's no way to focus an engine. A way to show
game developers that C++ has competition? Definitely! What about giving back
to the open source community? Absolutely, the sharing of knowledge is the
only reason any of us got to where we are now. And what have XNA/Monogame
been up to since we started working on this? We could push the
programmer-facing game engine aspect forward by providing modern features
that can fill the gap between Monogame and Unity. Now we're talking.</p>

<p>Leading up to GDC we had been hoping to get a demo of Spectral done so we could
film it and show off our progress. However, like normal developers we could not
go with Plan A, so we used Plan B: talking. As it turns out, that's all we
really had the ability to do in most of our conversations anyway. From
<a href="http://blog.danieljost.com/gdc-2014-post-mortem/">Daniel's retrospective</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had deep discussions with Epic, Crytek, and
<a href="https://www.madewithmarmalade.com/">Marmalade</a> about our Dash engine,
resulting in great advice and great contacts. All of us spoke with numerous
industry developers that were excited to hear from us and expressed interest
in hearing from us going forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking back on it the one thing those of us who went will remember is getting
to meet with <a href="http://erdani.com/">Andrei Alexandrescu</a>, the co-creator of the
<a href="http://dlang.org/">D language</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The meeting went by in a blur. We went in with some prepared questions and
topics relating to D and our engine, but in the couple hours we talked
neither subject hardly came up. Instead we had an honest and exciting
discussion about our future, working in the games industry vs. general
software engineering, and random life stuff. Eric left with a full-time
interview at Facebook and Colden, Brandon, and I have the same opportunity
once we look for full-time jobs.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-public-launch"><a class="header" href="#the-first-public-launch">The first public launch</a></h2>
<p>Now, of course, the project had been developed in the open and was technically
public. But as we neared the end of the semester (May 2014) we thought it would
be cool to share Dash around as <code>0.9.0</code> shipped. The team thought we had enough
features to make people interested and we wanted to gather feedback about what
the larger public thought we should focus on in future releases.</p>
<p>When we began sharing it we didn't know what to expect. We ended up getting a
heck of a lot more attention than we had even dreamed of. We were at the top of
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/25yw89/dash_an_opensource_game_engine_coded_in_d/">/r/programming</a>
for half a day, ranked well in <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/25yub3/introducing_dash_an_opensource_game_engine_in_d/">/r/gamedev</a>,
had 3 pages of dicussion on the <a href="http://forum.dlang.org/thread/qnaqymkehjvopwxwvwig@forum.dlang.org">D forums</a>,
and the Github repo was viewed thousands of times. In fact, we were viewed so
much we were rank 22 in the <a href="https://github.com/trending">Trending</a> section of
Github. I wish I had concrete stats, but I know we gained over 100 stars on
Github and 200 likes on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CircularStudios">Facebook</a>. A
week later we even caught wind of some <a href="https://twitter.com/yasei_no_otoko/status/471477564129947648">Japanese conversation on
Twitter</a>. We even
had a number of people start following our
<a href="https://gitter.im/Circular-Studios/Dash">chat room on Gitter</a>.</p>
<p>We had a a number of things that helped enable our success. We put the Facebook
page up a couple weeks ahead of the launch so that it already had a small
following and would look more legitimate to newcomers. We had created a landing
page for Circular Studios with brief explanations of Dash and Spectral that
linked to places like the Github. The website was hosted on Amazon S3, so the
wave of traffic didn't slow it down or bring it down entirely. We had the larger
points of being the first 3D engine in the D language and being one of a
handful of FOSS-licensed game engines helping us out as well.</p>
<h2 id="why-open-source"><a class="header" href="#why-open-source">Why Open Source?</a></h2>
<p>Dash went the open source route for a number of the same reasons that many
projects choose to open source: increased visibility, giving to / getting
support from like-minded developers, and better project management. Keep in
mind this wasn't an overnight decision: Dash developers come from the land of
game development, which has a pretty bad track record with open source, and we
were no exception. The prior iterations of Dash had been closed, both because
we hadn't been introduced to the idea of open source development and because
the engine was so closely tied to whatever game was being worked at the time
that the code repositories were inseparable.</p>
<p>When we decided to rebuild the engine in D and make it open source, it was also
decided that we should have a game team developing a game alongside the engine.
This has a number of benefits that are covered
<a href="http://blog.danieljost.com/the-vision-of-circular-studios-fall-2014/">here</a>,
but one thing to point out is that the game was kept closed source. This is
important to bring up: <em>not all projects are better as open source projects</em>.
Games haven't really figured out how to be open source and commercially
successful (not to discount modding). Code is one thing, but art assets and
game design documents are not built to be shared for free, publicly. That is
not to say we did not take advantage of GitHub's issues, pull requests, and
open source-style development. And we are talking about open sourcing the
project if we move on without the intention to make profit.</p>
<p>All that to say, evaluate your project's needs upfront and decide if open
source makes the most sense. By reading this book you are better informing
yourself of the option to open source and the benefits it brings to a project.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project"><a class="header" href="#how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project">How to Contribute to an Open Source Project</a></h1>
<p>So you've found that sweet open source project that you want to get involved
with. Now what? The first thing you should do is look for that project's guide
on how to get started with contributing. Often, this will be in a file called
CONTRIBUTING, or on the project's wiki. These guides will often explain
everything you need to know about how the project management team expects people
to work. Things often covered include how to build and test the project, how to
submit patches, and what communication channels to pay attention to. Node.js has
a great <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contributing guide</a>
if you'd like to see an example of what these files often contain.</p>
<p>If the project you'd like to contribute to doesn't have such a guide, it's not
that big of a deal. It probably just means that the project hasn't seen that
many external contributors, or that it just uses a very standard workflow. If
the project is hosted on GitHub or BitBucket, chances are the project uses
GitHub Flow for code contributions.
<a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">This guide</a> by GitHub has a
pretty good description of how the process works. The project probably uses
GitHub Issues as an issue tracker, which is a very easy to use system.</p>
<p>Alright, so you've read the guide, and figured out how the project works, and
you're ready to start making a difference. Where do you start? The easiest way
to join the community is by filing and commenting on issues. The first step of
fixing a problem is making sure it's known. Filing good, descriptive issues is
extremely helpful to the project maintainers, as it tells them where they should
be focusing their efforts. Keeping track of and reviewing pull requests is
another great way to get involved. It helps you stay up to date with what's
happening with the project, and who knows, maybe you'll spot the next
project-breaking typo that slipped past everyone else.</p>
<p>Another great way to ease your way into a project is by doing some repository
cleanup. This can include updating documentation, making sure code fits the
project's standards, or making the readme prettier. All of these are tasks that
are very important, but often project contributors won't take the time to do
them themselves.</p>
<p>Once you've settled into working with the project's community, it may finally be
time to start writing code. This can be a daunting task; submitting your first
patch is definitely a scary thing to undertake. When deciding what to tackle
first, it's probably best to start with something relatively simple that has
already been documented to increase your chances of having the patch accepted.
The simple the changes, and the easier your code is to read, the more likely it
is that someone will review it quickly, and merge it. The patch is also more
likely to be accepted if it solves an issue that people are already looking out
for.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This effort is aided by the fact that people generally show up expecting and
looking for social norms. That's just how humans are built. In any group unified
by a common endeavor, people who join instinctively search for behaviors that
will mark them as part of the group. The goal of setting precedents early is to
make those "in-group" behaviors be ones that are useful to the project; once
established, they will be largely self-perpetuating.</p>

<h2 id="benevolent-dictators"><a class="header" href="#benevolent-dictators">Benevolent Dictators</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>benevolent dictator</em> model is exactly what it sounds like: final
decision-making authority rests with one person, who, by virtue of personality
and experience, is expected to use it wisely.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Although "benevolent dictator" (or BD) is the standard term for this role, it
would be better to think of it as "community-approved arbitrator" or "judge".
Generally, benevolent dictators do not actually make all the decisions, or even
most of the decisions. It's unlikely that one person could have enough expertise
to make consistently good decisions across all areas of the project, and anyway,
quality developers won't stay around unless they have some influence on the
project's direction. Therefore, benevolent dictators commonly do not dictate
much. Instead, they let things work themselves out through discussion and
experimentation whenever possible. They participate in those discussions
themselves, but as regular developers, often deferring to an area maintainer
who has more expertise. Only when it is clear that no consensus can be reached,
and that most of the group wants someone to guide the decision so that
development can move on, does she put her foot down and say "This is the way
it's going to be." Reluctance to make decisions by fiat is a trait shared by
almost all successful benevolent dictators; it is one of the reasons they manage
to keep the role.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may also see a BDFL, or Benevolent Dictator For Life, run a project. This
means the person is in charge until they pass the mantle onto another BDFL or to
the community.</p>
<h2 id="write-it-down"><a class="header" href="#write-it-down">Write It Down</a></h2>
<p>Once you have established a set of operating rules, you should write it down so
that new developers can quickly bring themselves up to speed. This will often be
stored in a CONTRIBUTING file in the top level of a project alongside the
README. You can see examples of this file for
<a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Bootstrap</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">jQuery</a>, and the

<h2 id="version-control-is-your-friend"><a class="header" href="#version-control-is-your-friend">Version Control Is Your Friend</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact that the project's source code is kept under version control means
that most decisions can be easily unmade. The most common way this happens is
that someone commits a change mistakenly thinking everyone would be happy with
it, only to be met with objections after the fact. It is typical for such
objections to start out with an obligatory apology for having missed out on
prior discussion, though this may be omitted if the objector finds no record of
such a discussion in the mailing list archives. Either way, there is no reason
for the tone of the discussion to be different after the change has been
committed than before. Any change can be reverted, at least until dependent
changes are introduced (i.e., new code that would break if the original change
were suddenly removed). The version control system gives the project a way to
undo the effects of bad or hasty judgement. This, in turn, frees people to
trust their instincts about how much feedback is necessary before doing
something.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This also means that the process of establishing consensus need not be very
formal. Most projects handle it by feel. Minor changes can go in with no
discussion, or with minimal discussion followed by a few nods of agreement.
For more significant changes, especially ones with the potential to destabilize
a lot of code, people should wait a day or two before assuming there is
consensus, the rationale being that no one should be marginalized in an
important conversation simply because he didn't check email frequently enough.</p>

<p>Git is easily the most popular version control system among open-source code
slingers[1]. While git may seem complex at first, it is relatively easy to
understand.</p>
<p>Git is a distributed version control system, meaning that changes are stored on
every developers' machines separately (hence, distributed). However, there is
usually a central server/service to host the code for everyone to access. This
is usually an online code forge (see chapter 7).</p>
<p>When a file is changed, it is marked as "modified" by git. You can then add it
to the index (or "stage" it) using the <code>git add</code> command. After you add your
files, you can then "commit" them using the <code>git commit</code> command. Changes are
stored as deltas, or changes. Whenever a file is changed and committed, git
stores the change that was made. You can then "push" the commit to the central
server using <code>git push</code>. Your teammates can then "pull" the changes onto their
machines using <code>git pull</code>. You should always pull before making any changes,
because if you pull after committing files, conflicts can result.</p>

free (but not Open Source) functionality such as pull requests, issue trackers,
and wikis. If you haven't already, you can read the <code>How to Git</code> chapter to
learn more about how git works.</p>
<p>There is more to GitHub than a visualization of a git repo. Let's go through a
"hypothetical" situation where you find a typo in this book and you, a
developer, want to fix it. Firstly, you'll want to fork the repo. Find the
button to fork the repo and GitHub will create a repository like
<code>github.com/your-username/HowToFOSS</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/512416/4519766/815d1212-4cca-11e4-9174-5743d9dbdddb.PNG" alt="GitHub watch, star, and fork buttons" /></p>
<p>Note: You might notice a couple other buttons nearby, <strong>Watch</strong> and <strong>Star</strong>.
Watching a repo will notify you when issues are created and commented on among
other things. Starring a repo is way of showing your approval and support of a
project, as well as acting as a bookmark for later.</p>
<p>Back to our scenario. You now have a clone of this book that you can do nearly
anything with. For now, you want more than anything to go and fix the chapter
containing the egregious spelling error. You can do this either by cloning the
repo or by editing the file directly on GitHub. By viewing the file directly
and clicking on the <strong>Edit</strong> button (ed. note: It is a pencil icon on the
current site), you will be brought to an editor that will allow you to make
changes, write a commit message, and create a commit in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>The world is very nearly a better place with that spelling error fixed. But how
do you get your changes into the book that you are reading right now? You
submit a <strong>Pull Request</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/512416/4519844/68624d42-4ccd-11e4-9072-f8b237d859c6.PNG" alt="GitHub pull request button" /></p>
<p>A pull request, or PR, will let the upstream developer know that you have made
changes that you would like to be included their repository. Clicking the green
button shown above will initiate a PR using all the commits exclusive to your
repo. If another commit is added to your repo after you've opened the PR, it
will be automatically included. After the upstream developer decides your code
is OK to merge, the PR will be closed and your code will be merged. GitHub has
a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">more in-depth
tutorial</a> of how pull
requests work if you would like more information.</p>
<p>Woo! The fix for the spelling error is now included in the book! But what do
you do with your forked repo? It is a matter of personal preference. In
general, if you do not plan on contributing in the future and you feel that
having a duplicated codebase might confuse people, delete the fork. Your
contributions will live on in the upstream repository and you will not lose
credit for your work.</p>
<h2 id="bitbucket"><a class="header" href="#bitbucket"><a href="chapters///bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a></a></h2>
<p>Bitbucket is built on <a href="chapters///mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a>, a
<a href="chapters///en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control">DVCS</a> similar to git.
Bitbucket is similar to GitHub, and now supports both git and Mercurial. Like
GitHub, it provides extra free, but not Open Source, features.</p>
<h2 id="codeplex"><a class="header" href="#codeplex"><a href="chapters///codeplex.com">CodePlex</a></a></h2>
<p>CodePlex is a Microsoft-backed code host primarily used for C# .NET projects.
With the recent transition of <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/dotnet">.NET to Github</a>
it would seem that Microsoft is beginning to move off of the platform.</p>
<h2 id="sourceforge"><a class="header" href="#sourceforge"><a href="chapters///sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a></a></h2>
<p>Any discussion of project hosts has to talk about SourceForge as its
significance a decade ago rivaled that of GitHub now. While the vast majority
of new projects are not started on SourceForge anymore, it still boasts some 30
million downloads of hosted software each week. Code on SourceForge is backed
by <a href="chapters///subversion.apache.org/">SVN</a>, a version control system that has been
losing conceptual ground to git and other systems for some time.</p>

<li>
<p>Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?</p>
<ul>
<li>It began as a message board in 1999. When more people became interested, the project became open source. The original commit for the project was May 14, 2000. The latest February 21, 2015.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who approves patches? How many people?</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently Dries Buytaert, Nathaniel Catchpole, Alex Pott, and Angela Byron make up the team of reviewers. The contributions are peer reviewed and then decided on by Dries or another of the core committers. Anyone can submit patches against Drupal core. <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/21778">https://www.drupal.org/node/21778</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted? How many total?</p>
<ul>
<li>The main reviewers are the only ones who have commit access. There are 37,610 people are counted as developers for the entire project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)</p>
<ul>
<li>There has been a lot of turnover for each successive version. Dries has always been among these people but the branch maintainers have changed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)</p>
<ul>
<li>Dries Buytaert</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?</p>
<ul>
<li>For the most part they are different developers, because it’s broken out into different projects. Drupal Core is the back-end for it and the front end is constantly updating when new people make new themes for it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is the project's participation trending and why?</p>
<ul>
<li>Recently participation has been trending downwards, but it looks like it’s because the project is in an extremely stable state right now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, while he’s definitely a major contributor, there’s a ton of documentation, and there’s an active development community.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the project would survive, but development would definitely slow down. There is a ton of documentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place? (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, they have a page in their community section that is specifically about getting involved. It talks about multiple different ways you can do this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive? Does it include code examples?</p>
<ul>
<li>Drupal has very extensive documentation. Quickly glancing through I couldn’t find any code examples, but there are links to a lot of other places you can look for help from.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?</p>
<ul>
<li>The first thing I would do is hop into their IRC channel and ask people there. If the people who are there couldn’t help then I’d head over to their forums at <a href="https://www.drupal.org/forum">https://www.drupal.org/forum</a> and seek additional help.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group? Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?</p>
<ul>
<li>It is currently a mix of hierarchical and ruled by a small group. While Dries Buytaert has the ultimate say in pretty much everything, there is a group of people who also help him make his decisions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?</p>
<ul>
<li>I normally work better in a more chaotic environment, but I could see myself putting out some decent work in this sort of structure.</li>

<p>Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, it does not have a source code repository and as such does not have commits, but Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) initiated development on OpenGL and released it January 1992. Before being released in this open standard, it was previously exclusive to SGI and known as IrisGL. Several companies were brought together to form the OpenGL Architecture Review Board that would oversee the OpenGL project. The change was a gradual one due to many functions of the API that wouldn’t work across multiple hardware platforms. To overcome this, OpenGL would support features unsupported by hardware, allowing for high-powered graphics on low-powered systems. Its main competitor was  Direct3D, implemented by Microsoft in 1995. Through December 1997 to 1999, an effort to unify the two, the Fahrenheit project, was created, but abandoned due to financial reasons. In 2006, control of OpenGL was transferred from the OpenGL Architecture Review Board to the Khronos Group. The most recent stable release (version 4.5) came out August 11, 2014.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who approves patches? How many people?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The member companies with voting rights. 84 Contributors + 12 Promoters (96 in total).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only members of the Khronos group are allowed to participate in construction of the latest standards. Standards that are in-progress are confidential to prevent patent trolling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first version was released by Mark Segal and Kurt Akeley in 1992. Releases and structural changes were then overseen by the OpenGL Architecture Review Board (ARB). In September 2006, the OpenGL ARB became the OpenGL Working Group under the Khronos Group. Many of the developers transferred with the rebranding, however few ties to the original creators, SGI, remain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mark Segal and Kurt Akeley released the first version in 1992. Their names have been the only two author’s names on version 2.0, released October 2004, and version 4.5, released February 2nd, 2015.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>N/A OpenGL is purely documentation and back-end testing</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a controversy about OpenGL’s 3.0 release codenamed “Longs Peak.” The uproar was caused by structural changes to the code’s classification of objects, rendering them immutable causing much of the software to be re-written. As a result, a much tamer upgrade was released for version 3.0, and several disappointed developers switched to Direct3D development.</p>
<p>Alongside the standard, Khronos Group also creates <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/">conformance tests</a> controlling who is allowed to use the OpenGL logo. One must sign up as either an Implementer, or an Adopter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is the project's participation trending and why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is included on such a wide array of devices that its only major competitor is Mircosoft’s DirectX graphics API. OpenGL comes standard in most graphical device drivers, and has NVIDIA as one of its conformant companies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, because the project is 90% documentation. Since the Khronos Group only designs the standards, the implementations are not affected. All finalized versions of the standard are publically released.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, see above</p>

<p>Anyone can <a href="https://www.khronos.org/members/join/">sign up</a> to become a Member of the Khronos Group. The membership fees range from $1000 - $60,000, although membership fees for Open Source organizations are often waived.

<blockquote>
<p>Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an implementer with a preference toward open-source I would enjoy working for this project. The structure detailed above does not take away from the programming experience. On the contrary, it resembles a balanced governance of the project overall: group of voting members is essential to any project that reflects multiple system functionality; adopters trademarking and publishing what works to demonstrate the new features of the project; ratified specifications get sent to a group of implementers; ISVs then receive this all and use vendor supplied drivers to release the specification royalty free. The only criticism I would have of the structure is that the implementers don’t seem to have much say about what gets voted on, but rather just do the developing.</p>

<p>Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ubuntu comes from the African word Ubuntu meaning 'humanity to others'. Ubuntu was founded in 2004 as a free and easy to use Linux Desktop that was designed to be part social and part economic: free software, available to everybody on the same terms, and funded through a portfolio of services provided by Canonical. This from Wikipedia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The project started before the initial release on 20 October 2004, The Warty Warthog Release. Ubuntu's latest release was on April 23, 2015, The <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/15.04/">Vivid Vervet</a> Release.</p>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the number is undoubtedly large, Ubuntu doesn’t have the information readily available to view. This is also tempered by which project you want to look at specifically.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn’t look like the team has changed all that much, at least according to <a href="https://launchpad.net/~techboard/+members">this</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, there are several people that contribute to various portions of Ubuntu.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While possible, it is doubtful that they are considering the amount of people using Ubuntu. It is more likely that there is more developing for the back-end though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is very little forward facing information from Ubuntu, so it is hard to find anything concrete without delving into the mailing lists surrounding different project aspects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is the project's participation trending and why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ubuntu is fairly popular, mostly because of how they do business and the thoroughness that they have with their product</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, Ubuntu is backed by a huge, globe-spanning corporation and thousands, if not millions, of users.</p>
<blockquote>

<p><em>Section adapted from <a href="http://www.teachingcopyright.org/handout/technology-history-worksheet">EFF Worksheet</a></em></p>
<p>For this section we will take a look at one of Canonical's products used to maintain servers: <a href="https://landscape.canonical.com/">Landscape</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Landscape (Product). Landscape was created by Canonical.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the technology designed to do? How is it used?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Landscape is designed to assist in monitoring, managing, and updating an entire Ubuntu infrastructure from one single interface.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who would benefit from using this technology?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Server owners/administrators, IT managers, and similar people who are in charge of the infrastructure or a part of it would benefit from using this product.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What kinds of companies or organizations (stakeholders) might have been concerned about the development of this technology? Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since landscape is supposed to work mainly with Ubuntu, it would not be a direct conflict with other operating systems. Therefore only companies who are developing a similar kind of technology for Ubuntu, or developers of other distros that are in competition with Ubuntu would be concerned with the development of this technology from a business standpoint.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does/Did an aspect of copyright law play a role in controversies about the technology? How?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GitHub is powered completely by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29">Git</a>, a distributed source control system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Git was originally started by Linus Torvalds, creator of the Linux kernel.</li>
<li>Git was initially started to track the Linux kernel and was then used by other projects.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the technology designed to do? How is it used?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Created to be a highly distributed SCM, GitHub based their entire product on using Git.</li>
<li>GitHub now uses git as the tool it uses to track most of their repos and interface with GitHub.</li>
<li>Contrary to popular belief, Git existed before GitHub. GitHub created a nice visual front end and a great central area for code repos.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Who would benefit from using this technology?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lots of people interested in working on the same set of files or tracking changes in files could potentially use Git.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What kinds of companies or organizations (stakeholders) might have been concerned about th
e development of this technology? Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Companies that market proprietary revision control systems would probably have been concerned about a free alternative that gained traction extremely quickly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does/Did an aspect of copyright law play a role in controversies about the technology? How?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The Linux kernel was originally tracked in BitKeeper, a properitary SCM.</li>
<li>Devs of BitKeeper resciended license to use it and the kernel was left in the cold.</li>
<li>Linus became fed up and created his own that would be FOSS so that incident could never happen again.</li>
<li>GitHub is not open source, leading to an ironic situation that one of the most central sites for FOSS software isn’t FOSS itself.</li>
<li>GitHub also has a default license that has been controversial over some of its terms.</li>

<p>Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All in all, WebKit is a huge open source community. I would call it a very set and mature codebase. It has no fear of suddenly stopping and powers a lot of the web out there. It has an interesting aspect to it since a private company like Apple is behind it all but it seems to work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>WebKit code started in 98, with KDE HTML layout engine. After some discussions, Apple ended up announcing Safari in 2003 which used JavaScriptCore. Eventually KHTML &amp; WebCore didn’t stay on the same page so Apple decided to fork into WebKit. Dave Hyatt announced in 2005 that Apple would open source WebKit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who approves patches? How many people?
Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a total of around 250 official committers and reviewers of the webkit project. See them all here.</p>
<p>To be a committer, you should follow and trust the project. A Committer gets nominated once they have around 10-20 good patches. They also have to show that they are not a potato and understand the policies and the collaboration behind the project.</p>
<p>To be a reviewer you should have a very good judgement and understanding of project policies and vision. You should at least submitted 80 good patches and should be an active member of the community. 3 Reviewers must second the acceptance/nomination of a new reviewer.</p>
<p>You can become inactive and get committer/reviewer status revoked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Changes a bit, since core contributions tend to be from companies, so as employees change contributors do as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, there are a lead reviewers, but there are way more than 1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No front-end work really, aside from documentation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple has a very clear bug lifecycle. They use mailing lists to take care of code reviews and a lot of the communication surrounding the community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is the project's participation trending and why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Downward slightly because of the Blink/WebKit fork, but since patches are still being shared it still is going pretty strong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?
In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>WebKit is strong and huge, no bus or raptor can stop it. As long as it has major corporations relying on it for a key part of their infrastructure we don't see it going anywhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/HighLevelOverview">There is a getting around section on the Wiki</a>, which is pretty short, but gives enough guidance to at least know where everything is and how to build it.</p>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Even those who have used it in the past still have an active interest since most Blink development still revolves around merging WebKit patches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does/Did an aspect of copyright law play a role in controversies about the technology? How?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There has not been a lot of controversy around the copyright itself, but there has been some internal conflict that lead to the Blink fork. For example: one engineer made a comment on the mailing list entitle WebKit Wishes prior to the fork that said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve worked at both Apple and Google.  The WebKit community is full of brilliant engineers.  <em>Yet I frequently feel a lack of trust in my (or others) judgement, or witness hot-headed remarks on bugs</em>, lists or IRC.  I don’t think it’s that people don’t trust me after nearly 8 years (!?) on this project, but rather that we forget, or fail to communicate trust among ourselves.  Social problems are perhaps harder to solve for us technical types, but I worry that for many of us it’s just become “us” and “them” and we’ve stopped trying. - emphasis ours</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How was this organization funded originally?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>KDE wasn't/isn't a company.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does this organization make revenue?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't, but other companies definitely use it in products that make money.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which specific Open Source Revenue Models are utilized?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple primarily makes money through merging the open source rendering/javascript engine that is WebKit into their proprietary browser Safari, which only runs on their OS, which only runs on their hardware. So at the end of the day it makes sense for their current revenue model as a company as a whole, they are very much a hardware company.</p>
<p>The benefit for making this open source is that 1) it was already open source when they got their hands on it, so it was a good starting place, 2) it allowed major corporations to not reinvent the wheel (especially pre-blink fork), with major contributions from not just Apple, but Google, Nokia, Blackberry, Amazon, Adobe, and many more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What investments/acquisitions has the organization made?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple has made a bunch, but WebKit itself hasn't.</p>

<p>Debian is a relatively large distribution, I think we would all agree, and is, as far as Linux distributions go, one of the most influental. So many projects and even other distributions are based off of Debian's code that every decision made by the folks behind Debian affects thousands of others, and hundreds of projects. We felt that because of the significance of the project, and the "pseudo-corporate" structure of the organization behind it, that Debian would be a good fit for our first "profile".</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hierarchical. An almost corporate structure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?</p>

<p>Yes. This is the kind of structure, IMHO, that keeps large FOSS projects alive.</p>

<p>Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>The unfortunately named "Eclipse Project" is the project dedicated to producing the Eclipse SDK. This name made sense back when there were only two or three projects at Eclipse, but now it is frequently referred to as the "Eclipse top-level project" to reduce confusion (or just "The Platform" when we're feeling grandiose).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?</p>
<ul>
<li>The most recent release was on June 26, 2013.</li>
<li>The initial Commit was in 2003.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who approves patches? How many people?</p>
<ul>
<li>https://eclipse.org/eclipse/team-leaders.php - These people each are responibile for a section of the project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted? How many total?</p>
<ul>
<li>PMC Leads</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)</p>
<ul>
<li>Mike Wilson has been at Eclipse since it’s founding.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone is responsible for QA and bugs. every project has a bug forum where everyone can post and contribute to bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is the project's participation trending and why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?</p>
<ul>
<li>I think it would pass the Raptor Test. There is a hoard of people behind Mike Wilson, and while he will be missed, i’m sure someone could step up to be the team lead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?</p>
<ul>
<li>Development would obviously be a little halted, but I believe it would be able to continue. Eclipse is backed by many big name companies, like IBM.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place? (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)</p>
<ul>
<li>New contributors would most likely not start on the top-level project. They should start on one of the many subprojects. For Example, a subproject Orion has a very extensive new-contributor guide and lots of quick starts. http://wiki.eclipse.org/Orion/Getting_the_source http://wiki.eclipse.org/Orion/Getting_Started_with_Orion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive? Does it include code examples?
http://www.eclipse.org/documentation/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re on a sub-project, the developers are very active on their IRC channels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group? Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?</p>
<ul>
<li>Hierarchical. Sub groups approve what patches get sent to the higher up groups, and the higher up groups determine what gets patched into the main project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?
<ul>
<li>The Eclipse Foundation was created in Feb. 2004 with a reorganization of the Eclipse Consortium. The Consortium had sponsors of HP, IBM, MontaVista, Intel, QNX Software Systems, SAP, and Serena Software. Today, the Eclipse Foundation’s sponsors are Actuate, 	IBM, Oracle, SAP, CA Inc and Google.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the technology designed to do? How is it used?
<ul>
<li>The Eclipse Foundation was created to be the steward of the Eclipse IDE and software development environment. The foundation was works to create new technologies that work with or compliment Eclipse.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who would benefit from using this technology?
<ul>
<li>Any developers looking to make plug-ins for Eclipse, software that uses Eclipse or reach the large audience that uses the IDE would want to work with the foundation to integrate well into the Eclipse ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What kinds of companies or organizations (stakeholders) might have been concerned about the development of this technology? Why?
<ul>
<li>As the technology is an old IBM project that is now open source, IBM cares deeply about the project as they started it in a way. Google’s mobile operating system, Android uses Java as its base language and many Java developers work in Eclipse, so Google is also interested in the well being of the IDE and thus the foundation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does/Did an aspect of copyright law play a role in controversies about the technology? How? There weren’t any issues that our team could find relating to copyright law.</li>

<p>Arch is a distribution of linux that “focuses on elegance, code correctness, minimalism, and simplicity (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux">source</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Began in 2002 at the hands of Judd Vinet, who wanted to create a minimalist linux distribution. The latest commit was ~1 day ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who approves patches? How many people?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are different sets of developers for different Arch repos:</p>
<ul>
<li>[core] and [extra] have 36 developers</li>
<li>[community] has 40 developers (also called "Trusted Users")</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See above</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Judd Vinet stepped down in 2007 due to time constraints. Control was given to Aaron Griffin, who is the current leader today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Judd Vinet, although he has been inactive in Arch development since 2007.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arch linux is primarily focussed on back end development, leaving the user to install their prefered front ends. The closest thing to a frontend would be the pacman CLI, which is developed by a small subset of the primary developers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is the project's participation trending and why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arch still remains popular, currently in position 9 on <a href="http://distrowatch.com/">distrowatch</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely. There are plenty of developers working on the core system, and plenty of documentation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since Arch has a large base of documentation, while it would hinder its growth, others would likely be able to pick up where the core team left off. After all, Arch strives for simplicity and minimalism in its code.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Coreboot is a fast and flexible open source firmware aimed to replace the proprietary BIOS seen in most computers by running a lightweight boot process designed to run only the necessary tasks. It is endorsed by the FSF.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>April 15th, 2003. Project started in 1999. Wednesday March 18th at 11:41 AM</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who approves patches? How many people?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every developer can vote on what can be added. After the patch hits a specific threshold, then they will be added on their own. Certain developers have the ability to give enough votes to auto-merge a commit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)</p>

<p>The project is based around creating a Free BIOS, so there isn’t really a front-end to speak of.</p>

<p>Yes, as Ron doesn’t appear that active as a developer any more</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?</p>

<p>Due to how the team manages committing code and the general maturity of the project, the project looks like it would be fine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Endorsed by FSF; Led by Minnich.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the technology designed to do? How is it used?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Open source replacement of BIOS firmware that does only the bare minimum system setup necessary before handing off control to a bootloader, kernel, BIOS, or other ELF executable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who would benefit from using this technology?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consumers interested in a completely open and libre system could benefit, but a mature coreboot could create benefits for players pretty much everywhere in the computer manufacturing market as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What kinds of companies or organizations (stakeholders) might have been concerned about the development of this technology? Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Companies like American Megatrends and other BIOS chip providers might be concerned, because the software serves as a replacement for the software they provide on their chips.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does/Did an aspect of copyright law play a role in controversies about the technology? How?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No major controversies regarding this software yet, to our knowledge.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The Software Freedom Conservancy is a non-profit organization whose purpose is to promote, improve, develop, and defend Free, Libre, and FLOSS projects.  They aim to provide a home and infrastructure for FLOSS projects and allow developers to focus more on developing. <a href="chapters/bizleg-case-studies/fiscal-sponsorship/sfconservancy.org">1</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conservancy was established in 2006 and started coordinating with the BusyBox in 2007.  In 2015, Conservancy announced they were funding litigation by Christoph Hellwig against VMWare for copyright violation in an ESXi product.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who approves patches? How many people?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conservancy is a legal team and supports FLOSS projects legally, but not in terms of patching.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?</p>

<p>No one controls commit access - not applicable</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The current team of directors includes: Jeremy Allison, Peter T. Brown, Mark Galassi, Bradley M. Kuhn, Mike Linksvayer, Martin Michlmayr, Stormy Peters, and Karen Sandler.  The current list of project members of the Software Freedom Conservancy are: <a href="chapters/bizleg-case-studies/fiscal-sponsorship/sfconservancy.org">1</a>

<blockquote>
<p>How is the project's participation trending and why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Conservancy appears to be popular amongst larger FLOSS projects who need the legal side of Open Source dealt with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seeing that there is a group of directors, the Conservancy would very likely pass the Raptor test.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Conservancy would take a big hit if they lost their directors due to a bus accident, but seeing as the backing members are mostly heavily invested large FLOSS projects, the members would probably see that the Conservancy was restored with new lawyers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The main decision makers are the board of directors. SFC can be considered as a lawyer group dedicated to helping open source projects.  Decisions ultimately are ruled by this small group, keeping the project owners stake in mind for the best interest of FOSS and the values it represents.</p>

<p>Ouya SDK examples is a repo showcasing games made in various game engines for developers to see what changes are needed to port their game to the Ouya game console.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Ouya SDK examples has its first commit on Tuesday June 4 2013. Since then, there has been a great deal of work to flesh out several example projects using a variety of technologies. Examples written in C#, JavaScript, Java, C++, and Lua. The latest commit was 20 minutes ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who approves patches? How many people?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nick Badal, Buddy, and Timothy Graupmann have commit access, and review/merge pull requests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the Ouya SDK examples, only 3 pull requests have been made. Only 4 issues have been filed, and the contributors list only has 4 people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, there has been significant turnover. Most notably, Muffi Ghadiali (VP of product development) left Ouya in 2014.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Julie Uhrman, one of the founders, and still with the company.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Ouya is meant to be a backend product, allowing third party developers to write their own games. Ouya’s main projects are the Ouya kernel, and the SDK examples.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most public repos have issue trackers disabled.</p>
<p>To achieve the $100 price point, the Ouya carried a hardware payload inferior to most android phones at the time. A poorly designed controller also disincentivized the products adoption. The Ouya suffered from a limited game library. Many games were also playable on other existing consoles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is the project's participation trending and why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The project has largely sank. It was largely attributed to a lackluster response from the development community, and bad public perception. See above for other flaws/problems with the Ouya.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since there is a fair amount of documentation for onboarding new developers, it is likely that the public-facing project would survive the loss of the most active contributor. The internal, modified version of android, however, appears to have become proprietary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The public-facing project would no doubt survive, since there is extensive documentation (as explained above). The internal android system, while it does not appear to be publically available, would most likely survive. The tumultuous turnover in the core development team would suggest that the project is quite capable of being handed off to new developers.</p>

<li>Bing Gordon</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

<p><em>Section adapted from <a href="http://www.teachingcopyright.org/handout/technology-history-worksheet">EFF Worksheet</a></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Ouya was created by the CEO of Boxer8, Julie Uhrman. It was started as an internal prototype, with Yves Behar designing the product. After making their prototype, a kickstarter was started which raised $8.6M, the initial investment into the company and product.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the technology designed to do? How is it used?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Ouya is a micro-console, a small device that plays video games with any HDTV. THe console being mirco means that it will be easy to travel with, letting players bring their big screen gaming with them out of their home. It works like any other game console, it needs power and a TV with HDMI. The player just need standard game controllers, such as a wired Xbox 360 controller, PS3 controller, or game controllers used on PCs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who would benefit from using this technology?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Media Enthusiasts that would like one device to play all their media, games, movies, TV, and music.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What kinds of companies or organizations (stakeholders) might have been concerned about the development of this technology? Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nvidia was originally very interested in the Ouya. In 2013, Nvidia launched the Nvidia Shield, a portable Android gaming device that uses the same hardware in the Ouya. Nvidia could have seen the Ouya as a testing ground for their own ideas about launching game hardware. Large gaming companies such as Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Activision, and EA were also closely watching the Ouya. This console had the possibility to disrupt their business and create a new standard for consumers playing game on their TVs.</p>

<p>Coinbase has decent amount of conference participation. Such as Money2020 and other BitCoin related conferences.</p>
<h2 id="community-architecture-15"><a class="header" href="#community-architecture-15">Community Architecture</a></h2>
<h3 id="history"><a class="header" href="#history">History</a></h3>
<p>Coinbase started when the bitcoin surge came about. It raised a lot in venture capital through Y-Combinator and it became an easy way to deal with your bitcoin wallet, and one of the early ones as well. It all started by the original founders in San Francisco, CA. Coinbase grew quick to about 1 million users in 2014 and has ever since gotten strong momentum</p>
<h3 id="licenses"><a class="header" href="#licenses">License(s)</a></h3>
<p>Toshi - MIT
Most other repos - MIT</p>
<p>###Getting commit/review access
The people in charged of commit access of coinbase are found here: https://github.com/orgs/coinbase/people</p>
<h3 id="getting-messy-with-code"><a class="header" href="#getting-messy-with-code">Getting Messy with Code</a></h3>
<p>This process is done through their GitHub organization repo.</p>
<h3 id="git-by-a-bus"><a class="header" href="#git-by-a-bus">Git by a bus?</a></h3>
<p>Passes, because there are a handful of people that own the repo.</p>
<h3 id="overview--product"><a class="header" href="#overview--product">Overview &amp; Product</a></h3>
<p>Coinbase is a company that builds great apps to interface with the bitcoin world. It’s major product is the bitcoin wallet they create which is a place where you can buy and sell bitcoin. It facilitates the process and basically slaps on a beautiful UI on the bitcoin system.</p>
<p>How this company relates to open source is unique, but also relevant since its one of the ‘young’ companies that integrate and revolve around open source. So they have an organization on github. This organization has a ton of projects, one of the largest ones being toshi. This repo is an implementation of the Bitcoin protocol in Ruby. It is what powers coinbase and they help drive the project forward. There are currently 6 owners of the coinbase org in GH, so that leads me to believe they are the lead devs. The company is also making money and hires people to keep major development.</p>
<p>Its a great example of a company that is literally paid to create and support FOSS software. Now I’m sure there are ‘secret puddings’ in the company that they keep private which is where the trick comes in. Similarly they are the ‘data holders’ of all the user base and all of peoples transactions which makes them valuable.</p>
<h2 id="business-and-revenue-model-10"><a class="header" href="#business-and-revenue-model-10">Business and Revenue Model</a></h2>
<p>Coinbase got most its funding mostly from venture capital. Once the product was created, Coinbase created a similar service such as Visa. Where 1% of all charges that go through are charged as a fee.</p>

<p>Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lantern is built by the Brave New Software Project, Inc, a registered 501c3 non-profit dedicated to using software to tackle tough global challenges.
Brave New Software’s founder and Lantern lead developer, Adam Fisk, was formerly a lead developer of the peer-to-peer file sharing services LimeWire
and LittleShoot. While working on these P2P architectures, Adam realized they could be useful in providing unfiltered internet access.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Initial Commit for the project is on July 7th, 2010. The latest commit was on May 18th, 2015.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who approves patches? How many people?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are 6 people who can approve of patches, though two seem to be the most active.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other than the 6 who can approve patches, there are only 11 other people with a history of commits to the project all together, and between them there is only around 100 commits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the github repo graphs, myleshorton has been the leader since the project started. From october 2013 on, oxtoacart has joined and contributed alot of code development.
These two have since then stayed and contributed steadily as the core team members.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Adam Fisk</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the commit history, it seems like the answer is yes, as there are so few commits outside of the top two contributors</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/issues">Issue Tracker</a>. Of note is an issue with Reset not working properly and messsing with people’s ability to
work the software: <a href="https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/issues/1841">Issue 1841</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is the project's participation trending and why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/graphs/contributors">Github contributor graph</a>. It seems to have gone down as time has went on,
though that has probably more to do with having less and less project critical work to do. That said, there are still several open issues and
development has seemed to recently picked up again after a long hault.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, from what we can tell, only 2 people have really contributed to the repo code wise, and even then the BDFL has had a lot more commits and has worked on the project way longer than the second leading contributor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably not. If the two main contributors were removed then the project would fall, due to most of the development knowledge being lost. Also, the project is fairly new, has not left beta stage yet, and has weak documentation. These factors will only hinder the project if it tries to revive itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/wiki">wiki</a> has links to a <a href="https://github.com/getlantern/lantern/wiki/Get-Involved">Get Involved page</a> and other various links that will help people start contributing towards the project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it include code examples?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The project does have documentation but it is weak, and no code samples are present other than some basic terminal / command line code to set up the project on various platforms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would head to the forums first as that seems to be the most active communication area.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The entire project is run by the BDFL Adam Fisk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hard to say, as it really doesn’t have a formal structure outside of “There is this thing to work on, someone should work on it”.</p>

<p>Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The project was started by Adam Fisk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the technology designed to do? How is it used?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was designed with the intention of spreading internet to those who would normally not be able to receive it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who would benefit from using this technology?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People in countries with heavily censored Internet (i.e. China, Iran).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What kinds of companies or organizations (stakeholders) might have been concerned about the development of this technology? Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly enough, Google has stepped forward with something similar in uProxy. This was worked on collaboratively with Adam Fisk in some regard, so not quite the same thing though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does/Did an aspect of copyright law play a role in controversies about the technology? How?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Has been strongly opposed by China, but otherwise, mostly silent. There has been some concern over the funding coming from the State department however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are <em>so</em> many subjects you could choose to profile, so why did you choose this one? What drew you into wanting to know more about the organization? How did you/your group decide on and agree?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Raspberry Pi is a well-known open hardware device, used in a variety of contexts. It helps kids learn programming, is used as the brain of many DIY/physical computing projects, and because it is so cheap, serves to help people get a computer who otherwise might not be able to afford one. The organization responsible for the device is a registered charity.</p>
<h2 id="organizational-details-17"><a class="header" href="#organizational-details-17">Organizational Details</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Is the subject of your profile a corporate entity?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What type?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A charitable organization (officially registered with the Charity Commission for England and Wales, UK registered charity 1129409).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When was it founded?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>May of 2009 (Board of trustees was assembled in years prior to this, though).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By whom?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eben Upton, Rob Mullins, Jack Lang, Alan Mycroft, Pete Lomas, and David Braben</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Original founder(s) still active?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, although Eben became CEO of Raspberry Pi (Trading) Ltd, responsible for engineering and trading activities, so the current CEO of the Raspberry Pi Foundation is Lance Howarth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Publicly Traded? Since when? Initial Stock Price? Current stock price?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nope, nope, nope.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Has the company made any acquisitions? If yes, which companies, and what were their core products?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not that we could find.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Has the company made any investments in other companies? If yes, which ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not in the traditional sense…according to the UK Charity Commission website, they have £0 investment income and £0 investment spending, though they have £1 of “long term investment” assets. They also partner with element14, Egoman, RS Components, and Allied Electronics for distribution of the Pi.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Number of Employees?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4, according to the UK Charity Commission website, though the same site also lists 6 members on its Board of Trustees.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The RPF doubled their income YoY last year, so pretty good. The Pi is one of the most popular SoC devices in the world, at a similar level of proliferation as the Arduino.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Several people were involved in the creation and are Pi trustees. Plus, the concept would survive, as there are competing devices to the Pi.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. There would be some difficultly in replacing them, but since the charity, trading company, concept, and software ecosystem are all established and involve countless individuals, the Pi would live on.</p>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)</p>

<p>The core team seems to have stayed fairly constant up until recently.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How is the project's participation trending and why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All participation ended for almost 6 months, and is only just now starting to pick back up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The project would most likely survive but wouldn't be updated for awhile if Cory were eaten by a raptor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The project would most likely survive but wouldn't be updated for awhile if the core team was hit by a bus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There doesn't seem to be any straight on-boarding process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it include code examples?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The project has some documentation but nothing to help a newbie jump in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the core contributors, in an issue on GitHub</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently it is ruled by a pair of individuals, David Rappo and Warren Konkel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, too disorganized for a newbie to jump into easily</p>

<ul>
<li>Originally started for only open source bounties.</li>

<li>Development on this version stopped in 2008.</li>

<p>Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Patreon is crowdfunding site allowing content creators to collect funding from their “Patrons”. Patreon allows for lone and recurring donations from the patrons, and takes a 5% commision. Content creators range from youtube stars, musicians, to podcasters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Patreon was founded on May 7th, 2013 by Jack Conte. Since then it has not had any major changes in design, usability, or functionality. As it is not software, there are no regular commits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who approves patches? How many people?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jack Conte and Sam Yam</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can’t see it; They’re a private company</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, Jack Conte and Sam Yam are still with the company, and it has continued to grow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jack Conte and Sam Yam</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, they have different people for development, design, and HR. They have more developers than designers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rather than having bugs/issues, patreon more often than not will have problems with the posts of users. In December 2014 there was a policy change to no longer allow pornographic photography, but NSFW content in other forms is still allowed on the site. Now there is currently a system in place where users can request moderators to mark “strikes” on creator’s content. Accumulate enough strikes, and you can have your account suspended.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is the project's participation trending and why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has been doing well. It gained 125,000 patrons in the first 18 months. Recurring pledges continue to increase.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, it would survive. While there may be a brief period of chaos while new moderators step in, most of the infrastructure is already in place, and would continue to run. In terms of the web development, since the site isn’t very intensive, or unique, it’s likely that new developers could pick up the code base quickly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company would have a period of several months when content isn’t as heavily moderated, the website might not support so much traffic, and the back-end wouldn’t be patched, but the company could hire new employees and continue their services.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simply <a href="https://www.patreon.com/signup">sign up</a> for an account. Any questions can likely be answered from the <a href="http://support.patreon.com/">FAQ</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it include code examples?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Patreon maintains a helpful <a href="http://support.patreon.com/">FAQ</a> with answers to questions regarding Creators and Patrons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://support.patreon.com/">FAQ</a> with information that might help. Depending on the blocker, you could also email privacy@patreon.com or copyright@patreon.com</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company is a small group, led by Jack Conte (the CEO), and Sam Yam (President &amp; Head of Technical).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an artistic creator, it would be pretty nice; the concept of the website is to give artists enough monetary support to have a sustainable income for their work. As a back-end developer or moderator, I don’t know about their system, as they are a private company.</p>

<p><em>Section adapted from <a href="http://www.teachingcopyright.org/handout/technology-history-worksheet">EFF Worksheet</a></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jack Conte and Sam Yam created Patreon in May 2013. That August they raised $1.3M in VC Funding. Patreon was founded so that founder Jack Conte could monetize his popular Youtube channel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the technology designed to do? How is it used?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creators/Artists can create an account and showcase their work. Artists can set a monthly limit that users can give them a month, attaching rewards/gifts to different tiers if they would like. Artists receive their pledges at the start of every month and can use them as they see fit, no financial records are need to be shown to Patreon or the artist’s pledging users. Patreon charges a flat 5% fee on all pledges.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who would benefit from using this technology?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Artists in any medium would benefit from this technology, as well as open source developers. As users pledge each month, this could be used a supplemental income at first for an artist and if they receive enough pledges, it could become their full income.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What kinds of companies or organizations (stakeholders) might have been concerned about the development of this technology? Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Record labels, content networks, and other organizations that host and promote artist on any medium are probably very concerned as Patreon is cutting them out as middlemen and giving artists an avenue to their fans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does/Did an aspect of copyright law play a role in controversies about the technology? How?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There have been no copyright cases/controversies surrounding patreon.</p>

<p>Who are some of the users of this service?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Initial commit was on April 26, 2014. The latest commit was on August 5, 2014.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who approves patches? How many people?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just our BDFL <a href="https://github.com/joepie91/">joepie91</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, our BDFL (joepie91) has most of the commits. There is however one other contributer who contributed 1 line of code, <a href="https://github.com/jedahan">jedahan</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is only the BDFL really, who has not changed</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The BDFL is joepie91.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, there is only 1 developer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The BDFL controls bug control and repair. There have been no major issues so far. Issue tracker can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/joepie91/pdfy/issues">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is the project's participation trending and why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Throughout the project's history, it has been actively developed by the BDFL with no real breaks. However development has stopped on August 5, 2014 and has not picked up since. Development seems to have switched over to <a href="https://github.com/joepie91/pdfy2">pdfy2</a>, a node.js port of pdfy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since there is only one developer, the project would not survive the raptor test.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the above answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no on-boarding process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it include code examples?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no documentation other than the github readme file which explains how to set up the project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You would have to contact the BDFL. Looks like most communications are done on the github issue tracker.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ruled by the BDFL.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the project is run by a single individual and is apparently dead, I would not enjoy working on this project.</p>

<p><em>Section adapted from <a href="http://www.teachingcopyright.org/handout/technology-history-worksheet">EFF Worksheet</a></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdfunding">Crowdfunding</a> was conceived before the internet. There are several examples in history where funds were raised by a large crowd of donors. The term 'crowdfunding' was introduced in 2006, and crowdfunding websites appeared as early as 2003 after the launch of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArtistShare">ArtistShare</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the technology designed to do? How is it used?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IndieGoGo is meant to allow people to start up any idea they want and crowdsource the funds from other people. Generally speaking, IndieGoGo is used to give ideas that normally wouldn’t get anywhere a chance in the light.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who would benefit from using this technology?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anybody can start a campaign. More directly, people who need just a little more funding before they can launch their project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What kinds of companies or organizations (stakeholders) might have been concerned about the development of this technology? Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The biggest concern about crowdsourcing in general is that legitimate startups circumvent the need for Venture-capital. This is merely postponing it, as the startups hit the point at which they need to expand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does/Did an aspect of copyright law play a role in controversies about the technology? How?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There has been some controversy surrounding IndieGoGo, but little to none of it has to do with copyright law. Namely IndieGoGo now no longer has the same fraud guarantees.</p>
<h2 id="business-and-revenue-model-16"><a class="header" href="#business-and-revenue-model-16">Business and Revenue Model</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>How was this organization funded originally?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The company has raised revenue from some financing rounds. The earliest one was in September 2011, where the company raised $1.5 million, a round led by Metamorphic Ventures, ff Venture Capital, MHS Capital and Steve Schoettler, Zynga's co-founder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does this organization make revenue?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IndieGoGo charges 9% on the funds you raise. If you meet your goal, you get 5% of them back. More information can be found at their <a href="https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/204456408-Fees-Pricing">Fees &amp; Pricing</a> page.</p>

<p>Gratipay is all about open. The company itself is one of the first ones to become an ‘open company’. Everything is open from financials to the source code, which is pretty cool. They have very simple goals in mind and they understand they need rules, so they have those as well.</p>
<p>It is just a simple service to help open people support open and free software by their mean. The payment itself is open by nature and so there is no scamming involved. Just people helping people and using technology to help out.</p>
<p>They have some revenue on a ‘pay what you want’ basis when a user executes a payment to another user.</p>
<p>To preserve the simpleness of the company I will leave the overview simple.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Chad is usually the go-to for fixing major bugs and issues.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is the project's participation trending and why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its in ever-increasing trend. Because the vision is very clean. Help little by little. Not billions, not nothing. Just give out of the heart.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?</p>

<p>No, Chad Whitacre is at the core of the team. Most accounts and formal legal monetary holdings are only owned by him.</p>

<p>No. Chad Whitacre is at the core of the team. Most accounts and formal legal monetary holdings are only owned by him.</p>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?</p>

<p>So mostly its reigned by a small group which is lead by Chad. However the consensus is built as a small community that gratipay has built.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Because of the nature of crowdsourcing platforms, we chose to study one of the
projects that came about thanks to Kickstarter.  Here, we will cover Pebble
Smartwatch.</p>

<p>https://developer.getpebble.com/blog</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Pebble Smartwatch was created to redefine the idea of a smartwatch. It was
one of the first smartwatches to sync with a smartphone, and ended up being
arguably the catalyst for interest in the smartwatch space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first Kickstarter campaign was launched on April 11, 2012, and the watch
was first shipped to backers in January, 2013. The latest version, Pebble Time,
began its Kickstarter campaign on February 24, 2015 (the watch has not shipped
yet, as of May 17, 2015).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who approves patches? How many people?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eric Migicovsky, Founder and CEO of Pebble and inventor of the watch, has a
large say, as well as the Head of Product, Itai Vonshak, and the Head of
Industrial Design, Mork Solomon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not applicable -- the watch is closed source.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of
contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original people are still at the helm.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator
for Life)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, but it is unlikely that Migicovsky will step down anytime soon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion
of each?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not applicable -- the watch is closed source.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during
development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not applicable -- the watch is closed source.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is the project's participation trending and why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interest seems to only be increasing.  The first Kickstarter pulled in $10.2M,
while the second recieved $20.3M.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the
project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a
Velociraptor?) Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering the overwhelming success of the platform, and the interest in
smartwatches overall, it is unlikely that any sort of disaster would leave
the company unable to pick up the (time)pieces.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active
20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new
contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically
on newbies, etc...)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the links to the developer resources above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it
include code examples?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the links to the developer resources above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit
blockers, who would you contact, and how?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not applicable -- the only way to help would be to contribute to their next
Kickstarter campaign.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making
structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building,
ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair
of individuals?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ruled by a small group.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the innovative mindsets of the Pebble team have given us a cool product
which has inspired competition from very large names.</p>

<p><em>Section adapted from
<a href="http://www.teachingcopyright.org/handout/technology-history-worksheet">EFF Worksheet</a></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eric Migicovsky was the original creator of the Pebble watch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the technology designed to do? How is it used?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's designed to allow users to keep in touch with their online lives without
taking out a device.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who would benefit from using this technology?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This technology would benefit both people who want to be less connected to
their phones (because they can stay connected without using their phone) as
well as people who want to stay hyperconnected (because they can stay connected
without using their phone).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What kinds of companies or organizations (stakeholders) might have been
concerned about the development of this technology? Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think only competing smartwatch producers would be concerned about the
development of the Pebble, and being that it wasn't a huge space when the
Pebble was first put on Kickstarter, I don't think any stakeholders would be
particularly concerned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does/Did an aspect of copyright law play a role in controversies about the
technology? How?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No.</p>

<li>The first commit was Apr 16, 2006. The latest commit was Apr 28, 2015.</li>

<li>There are 62 people who have had commits accepted into the main project.</li>
<li>The core commiters have changed over time. At the beggining there were 3 major commiters who haven't added anything in awhile.</li>
<li>Daniel Varvaez is the Lead maintainer for the core sugar project.</li>
<li>There are different people working on the frontend and the backend.</li>
<li>Participation seems to be trending down recently but there was a big push between October 2014 and January 2015.</li>
<li>The project would pass the raptor test as there are multiple people running each team.</li>
<li>I don't think this project would pass the bus test. The documentations isn't as detailed as it could be.</li>
<li>Contributing to both the main process and adding new activities has a well documented getting started guide.</li>
<li>The documentation is well broken up so you only need to look at the things for the particular thing you're doing, such as the main project or an activiy.</li>

Managers then go find other people to work on the projects, and delegate the work amongst them, keeping time and release cycles flowing. analytics.usa.gov is an example of a project that applies to many levels, as there are more sites like it at city and state levels.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who approves patches? How many people?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 75 people viewable from their <a href="https://github.com/orgs/18f/people">repo list</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don’t know, their core team isn’t so clear since they work on so many projects simultaneously.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unclear. Aaron Snow is the only listed employee on Crunchbase, was one of the founders, and is still working with them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many of the developers at 18f are skilled in both frontend and backend roles. Most developers are skilled with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Healthcare.gov - USDS is the government’s sector responsible for quality control and bug repair on all its digital services.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is the project's participation trending and why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are trending well. Several of their repos on github have over 200 stars.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, they have many projects, all spearheaded by different people. Also, the managers are there to find new people for whichever projects they are interested in pursuing, allowing for people to be replaced.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Same as previous answer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For developers, 18f has some basic bootstrapping documentation on their <a href="https://docs.18f.gov/">docs page</a>. For their consulting work within government, the have a repository called <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/guides/">guides</a> that details many of their practices (accessability, testing, open-source policies, etc).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it include code examples?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>18f holds several <a href="https://docs.18f.gov/">documentation repos</a> (or similar) on github. See above, since much of their on-boarding and guides can be considered documentation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 18f github repositories have fairly active issue trackers. You may also send email to 18f@gsa.gov</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a very flat structure, seemingly barely contained chaos (a departure from typical government structure). Any member may develop or launch any project of their choosing, and only need consent when forming a "Guild" within 18f. This loose structure of self-organisation was designed to enable flexibility and speed. More details can be found in their <a href="http://18f.github.io/grouplet-playbook/">Grouplet Playbook</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, having the ability to work on projects of my choosing would allow me to quickly find (or start) projects that I care about.</p>

<p><em>Section adapted from <a href="http://www.teachingcopyright.org/handout/technology-history-worksheet">EFF Worksheet</a></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Government</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the technology designed to do? How is it used?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Create optimal, transparent, and functional software to digitally lead the United States into a better tomorrow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who would benefit from using this technology?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firstly, the U.S. Government. The technology is created to be used by them on whatever level can apply their data into the systems. 18f works with the different branches and groups within the government to create profitable solutions directly for them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What kinds of companies or organizations (stakeholders) might have been concerned about the development of this technology? Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Government Associations, groups, organizations, and subsidiaries. 18f was created shortly after the fiasco of Healthcare.gov to prevent new software from encountering such issues. Now, they are the ones creating the new technologies and helping others to learn how to use and improve their software, which by default is all open source in the U.S. Public Domain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does/Did an aspect of copyright law play a role in controversies about the technology? How?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No controversies yet; by default they release software in the public domain, with some exceptions. If they work on code that isn’t open source, or is protected by the International Traffic in Arms Regulation, for example, then it would qualify as an exception. The finer details of their policy can be found in their <a href="https://github.com/18f/open-source-policy/blob/master/policy.md">open-source-policy</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who are some of the users of this service?
The government is the biggest user of 18f, having created it to bring about digital solutions to their problems to usher us toward a future aligned with their goals.</p>

<p>Dependency-check is an open source solution the OWASP Top 10 2013 entry: A9 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities. Dependency-check can currently be used to scan Java applications (and their dependent libraries) to identify known vulnerable components.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Initial commit was on September 6th, 2012. Latest commit was on May 6th, 2015.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who approves patches? How many people?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jeremy Long is the only one who can approve patches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There have been 12 contributors to the project overall. Anyone seems to be able to submit pull requests, but only Jeremy Long can approve them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There has been no change in the core team since there really is no core team, just the BDFL, who has stayed active for the entire duration of the project's history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jeremy Long is the BDFL.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since Jeremy Long is the main developer by an overwhelming majority, the front and back end developers are the same people (or rather the same person, the BDFL).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There have been no major bugs or problems within the project code wise, and there is no clear indication as to who is in charge of problems. We assume it is the BDFL.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is the project's participation trending and why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The project's participation trending is fairly consistent with Jeremy Long committing most of the code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The project would not survive the Raptor test since only one person has really contributed to the project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The project would not survive the Git by a bus test since only one person has really contributed to the project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no clear indication of an on-boarding process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it include code examples?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For documentation, <a href="http://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/">http://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/</a> has a large amount of information about the project, but nothing as far as code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contributing to the project will most likely need to be started by contacting the BDFL Jeremy Long on the mailing list via <a href="chapters/bizleg-case-studies/light-side-dark-side/dependency-check+subscribe@googlegroups.com">Subscribe</a> or <a href="https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/wiki/dependency-check@googlegroups.com">Post</a></p>
<blockquote>

<p>It is no doubt ruled by a single individual, the BDFL Jeremy Long</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?</p>

<ul>
<li>#tor - User and relay operation discussions. Having trouble running Tor or a

<li>#tor-dev - Channel for people who want to do development. Discussions about
Tor-related coding, protocols, and project ideas are all welcome.</li>
<li>#tor-project - Organization discussions unrelated to software development. A
great place to discuss Tor community events, outreach, translation, or
website improvements.</li>
<li>#nottor - This is where Tor people hang out to talk about stuff that is not
related to Tor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tor also has three mailing lists:</p>
<ul>

<p>Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>135 people have contributed and ~15 have commit access.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of
contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The core team has, to this date, never changed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator
for Life)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The BDFL is Nick Mathewson.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion
of each?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on a quick look through the
<a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/corepeople.html.en">core people page</a>, it
appears that different people work on different parts of the project. It is
difficult, however, to get a sense of what the proportions are, as a lot of
developers work on several different projects within Tor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during
development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Presumably, the project leads are responsible for quality control and bug
repair within their individual projects. A list of major problems that Tor has
dealt with is available on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_%28anonymity_network%29#Weaknesses">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is the project's participation trending and why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Participation has been consistently trending upwards, probably because of the
increased concern in security due to recent events in the US.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the
project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a
Velociraptor?) Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No:  50.3% of commits to the repo are by a single developer -- if that
developer left, the project may continue through community support, but there
will definitely be significant shocks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active
20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly to the Raptor Test, the project has the potential to be continued by
those with a community interest, but 80.3% of commits were made by the top
two contributers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new
contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on
newbies, etc...)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Helpful utilities for new developers can be found in
<a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/githax.git/">this repo</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it
include code examples?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>https://www.torproject.org/docs/documentation.html.en</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit
blockers, who would you contact, and how?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We would visit the team on IRC or get help through the mailing lists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making
structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building,
ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair
of individuals?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on the commit data and core people page, we would conclude that it is a
combination of heirarchical and ruled by a pair of individuals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking for myself, I would be alright working in this sort of community,
as there would be someone above me to consult with on issues, and someone to
catch any fatal mistakes I happen to make.</p>

<p><em>Section adapted from <a href="http://www.teachingcopyright.org/handout/technology-history-worksheet">EFF Worksheet</a></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who invented, created, or sponsored the technology?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Paul Syverson was the inventor of onion routing, while Roger Dingledine,
Nick Mathewson, and Paul Syverson were the original three developers of Tor.
Contributors in the United States government contribute approximately 80% of
Tor's funding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the technology designed to do? How is it used?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tor is designed to make it difficult to trace Internet activity back to the
user by routing packets through several relays that have only limited
knowledge of where the packet came from and where the packet is headed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who would benefit from using this technology?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone who desires to keep their Internet usage private would benefit from Tor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What kinds of companies or organizations (stakeholders) might have been
concerned about the development of this technology? Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any governmental institution that might want to have access to or control the
Internet usage of their constituents would likely be concerned.  Interestingly,
those same actors might also be interested in the project -- the reason that
the United States Department of Defense funds the project, for example, is
because they want access to an 'anonymization' service that is not only used
by governmental agencies, but also by regular citizens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does/Did an aspect of copyright law play a role in controversies about the
technology? How?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While users could in theory use Tor or similar services to anonymize their
traffic while engaging in copyright infringement, most controversies have been
related to drugs and other illict activity.</p>
<h2 id="business-and-revenue-model-21"><a class="header" href="#business-and-revenue-model-21">Business and Revenue Model</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>How was this organization funded originally?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The project was originally created by DARPA -- when the code was open-sourced
in 2004, the EFF funded some of the original developers to continue development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does this organization make revenue?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This organization makes revenue primarily through research grant-like
agreements with governmental organizations in the US, as well as donations from
other organizations and individuals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which specific Open Source Revenue Models are utilized?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This organization does not fit all that cleanly into the revenue models
discussed -- it is essentially contracted to work on the open source project
by a government.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What investments/acquisitions has the organization made?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The organization has made no investments or acquisitions, to our knowledge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Describe the software project, its purpose and goals.
Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest commit?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Ushahidi group was formed originally to gather crisis information from the public to show what actually is happening in real time. It basically leverages the power of information carriage in places where information can be oppressed.</p>
<p>In order to do this they provide many products like a map maker and a gather of local posts.
A great example is Syria NET which gathers real time information from (sadly) violence and how its spreading across the Syrian land.</p>
<p>Ushahidi has grown to be more than just focus on crisis data sources and has abstracted its way of manipulating data and extending it to other use cases.</p>
<p>It is 100% open since it seems the organization focuses on opening the gateways of data for individuals to form accurate and transparent representations of the events that are happening.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who approves patches? How many people?
Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 20 people in charge of commit access for Ushahidi are here: <a href="https://github.com/orgs/ushahidi/people">github.com/orgs/ushahidi/people</a></p>
<p>14 people have had patches accepted, some within and outside of the organization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the top 20% of contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stayed primarily the same across projects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator for Life)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David is pretty influential, but the work load is fairly spread throughout the organization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of each?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not applicable to every project, but when it is they tend to be the same people for major contributors (obviously smaller contributors tend to stick with one side of platform).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are currently 200 open issues and 999 closed issues in ushahidi’s main project(https://github.com/ushahidi/Ushahidi_Web/issues) indicating that while, there bugs present in the code, the developers are actively working to maintain their projects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How is the project's participation trending and why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Downward on some projects (e.g the main platform), up on others (e.g. BRCK), it seems they focus resources on different projects as time goes on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a Velociraptor?) Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a decent number of developers with pretty large consistent commits, so it’s pretty safe to say this would survive the raptor test</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20% of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably would take a big hit from the bus test.  Aside from the main contributors, commits are very small and inconsistent, but the project is important and serves a good cause, so the project would most likely survive</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on newbies, etc...)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone can help out, <a href="https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Ushahidi+v2.X+Developer+Guide">they have an onboarding guide found here</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it include code examples?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Wiki and Forum are quite active and helpful for contributors and users (who may not be tech savvy, e.g. reporters).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit blockers, who would you contact, and how?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reach out on IRC or the forums probably.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making structure/process of this group? Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of individuals?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks like no formal process, just make a PR and talk about until someone inside decides its good or not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It looks like it works for this type of organization, but a more formal structure might be beneficial.</p>
