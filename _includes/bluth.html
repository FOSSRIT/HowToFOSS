Stack the chafing dishes outside by the mailbox. I'm on the job. Fried cheese… with club sauce. Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce. Chicken fingers… with spicy club sauce. Uncle Gob… was Aunt Lindsay ever pregnant? Yeah, sure, dozens of times. It walked on my pillow! Pound is tic-tac-toe, right? When a.. man.. needs to prove to a woman that he's actually.. [pause].. When a man loves a woman.. A million ****ing diamonds!

Wine only turns to alcohol if you let it sit. What do you think about Sudden Valley? It sounds like a salad dressing, but for some reason I don't want to eat it. Hair up, glasses off. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. Yeah, like I'm going to spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit? Come on! I'm foolish and I'm funny and I'm needy. Am I needy? Are you sure I'm not needy? 'Cause I feel needy sometimes. It was for me. I was going to smoke the marijuana like a cigarette.

It's as Ann as the nose on Plain's face. Heart attack never stopped old big bear. This is not me encouraging you to go here and write a review. No. Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In laymans terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. I could use a leather jacket for when I'm on my hog and have to go into a controlled slide. Oh, yes, there absolutely will be a margarita made in my mouth. Fried cheese… with club sauce. Annyong.
